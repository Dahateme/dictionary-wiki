adjective

1. going beyond the limits (of proper behaviour), too self\-sure, overbearing, arrogant, proud SN.i.239 (variant reading accayasara caused by prolepsis of foll. accaya); Ja.iv.6 (atisara); Dhp\-a.iv.230 (= expecting too much).
2. going beyond the limits (of understanding), beyond grasp, transcendental (of *[pañha](pañha.md)* a question) MN.i.304; SN.v.218 (variant reading SS for BB reading ajjhapara). Cp. accasārin.

a form. fr. aor. accasari (ati \+ *sṛ*;), influenced in meaning by analogy of ati \+ a \+ sara *(smṛ)* Not with Morris (J.P.T.S. 1889, 200) a corruption of accaya \+ sara *(smṛ)*, thus meaning “mindful of a fault”
