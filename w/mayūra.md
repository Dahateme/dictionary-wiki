peacock DN.iii.201; SN.ii.279; Thag.1113; Ja.ii.144, Ja.ii.150 (˚gīva) = Dhp\-a.i.144; Ja.iv.211 (˚nacca); Ja.v.304; Ja.vi.172, Ja.vi.272, Ja.vi.483; Vv.11#1, Vv.35#8 (= sikhaṇḍin Vv\-a.163); Vv\-a.27 (˚gīva\-vaṇṇa); Sdhp.92. The form *[mayūra](mayūra.md)* occurs nearly always in the Gāthās and is the older form of the two m. and *[mora](mora.md)*. The latter contracted form is found in Prose only and is often used to explain the old form, e, g. at Vv\-a.57. See also *[mora](mora.md)*.
