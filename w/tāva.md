### I ###

*yāva\-tāva* as long as: yāva dve janā avasiṭṭhā ahesuṃ tāva aññamaññaṃ ghātayiṃsu Ja.i.254; yāva dukkhā nirayā idha tattha pi tāva ciraṃ vasitabbaṃ Snp.678. Neg. na tāva\-yāva na not until MN.i.428; SN.v.261; AN.i.141≈(na t. kālaṃ karoti yāva na taṃ pāpakammaṃ byantihoti he does not die until his evil kamma is exhausted).

### II *Elliptical:* ###
