adjective Primary meanings are “inside” and “in between” as adj. “inner”; in prep. use & in compounds “inside, in between”. Further development of meaning is with a view of contrasting the (two) sides of the inside relation, i.e. having a space between, different from; thus nt. *antaraṃ* difference.
