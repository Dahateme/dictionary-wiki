```

to get bewildered to be infatuated, to become dull in one’s senses, to be stupified. Just as rāga, dosa & moha form a set, so do the verbs rajjati, dussati, muyhati, e.g. Mil.386 (rajjasi rajjanīyesu, dussanīyesu dussasi muyhase mohaniyesu). Otherwise rare as finite verb only Dhs\-a.254 (in defn of moha) & Sdhp.282, Sdhp.605 (so read for mayhate)  
pp *mūḷha & muddha1*.

Vedic muhyati, *muh*; defn Dhtp.343: mucchāyaṃ; 460: vecitte; cp. moha & momuha
