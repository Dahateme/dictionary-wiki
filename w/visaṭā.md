Visaṭā & visatā

feminine “hanging on,” clinging, attachment. The word seems to be a quasi\-short form of *[visattikā](visattikā.md)*. Thus at Snp.715 (= taṇhā C.; spelling t); Dhs.1059 (translation “diffusion,” i.e. fr. vi \+ *sṛ*; spelling ṭ) = Cnd. s.v. *taṇhā* (spelt with t).

abrh. formation fr. vi \+ *sañj*, spelling t for tt: see *[visatta](visatta.md)*. The writing of MSS. concerning t in these words is very confused
