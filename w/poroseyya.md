= porisiya (cp. porisa1 1) fit for man, human MN.i.366. The word is somewhat doubtful, but in all likelihood it is a derivation fr. pura (cp. porin; Sk \*paura), thus to be understood as \*paurasya → \*porasya → \*poraseyya → \*poroseyya with assimilation. The meaning is clearly “very fine, urbane, fashionable” thus *not* derived from purisa, although C. explains by “puris’ ânucchavikaṃ yānaṃ” (MN.i.561). The passage runs “yānaṃ poroseyyaṃ pavara\-maṇi\-kuṇḍalaṃ” with vv.ll. *voropeyya & oropeyya*. Neumann accepts *oropeyya* as reading & translates (wrongly) “belüde” see *Mittl. Slg.* 21921; vol. ii. pp. 45 & 666. The reading; *[poroseyya](poroseyya.md)* seems to be established as lectio difficilior On form see also Trenckner, *Notes* 75.
