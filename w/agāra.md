1. house or hut, usually implying the comforts of living at home as opp. to *anagāra* homelessness or the state of a homeless wanderer (mendicant). See *anagāriyā*  
   ■ Thus freq. in two phrases contrasting the state of a householder (or layman, cp *[gihin](gihin.md)*), with that of a religious wanderer *(pabbajita)* viz.
   1. *kesamassuṃ ohāretvā kāsāyāni vatthāni acchādetvā agārasmā anagāriyaṃ pabbajati* “to shave off hair & beard, put on the yellow robes, and wander forth out of the home into the homeless state” DN.i.60 etc. cp. Cnd.172#ii. See also SN.i.185 (*agārasmā anagāriyaṃ nikkhanta*); MN.ii.55 *(agāraṃ ajjhāvasatā)*; Snp.274, Snp.805 *(˚ṃ āvasati)*, and with *[pabbajita](pabbajita.md)* DN.i.89, DN.i.115, DN.i.202, DN.i.230; Pv.ii.13#17
   2. of a “rājā cakkavattin” compared with a “sambuddha”: *sace agāraṃ āvasati vijeyya paṭhaviṃ imaṃ adaṇḍena asatthena… sace ca so pabbajati agārā anagāriyaṃ vivaṭacchado sambuddho arahā bhavissati* “he will become the greatest king when he stays at home, but the greatest saint when he takes up the homeless life”, the prophesy made for the infant Gotama DN.ii.16; Snp.1002, Snp.1003  
      ■ Further passages for *[agāra](agāra.md)* e.g. Vin.i.15; DN.i.102 (BB. has variant reading *agyāgāra*, but DN\-a.i.270 expl. as *dānāgāra*); AN.i.156, AN.i.281; AN.ii.52 sq. Dhp.14, Dhp.140; Ja.i.51, Ja.i.56; Ja.iii.392; Dpvs.i.36.

2. *anagāra* (adj.) houseless, homeless; a mendicant (opp. *[gahaṭṭha](gahaṭṭha.md)* Snp.628 = Dhp.404; Snp.639, Snp.640 (\+ *paribbaje*); Pv.ii.2#5 (= *[anāvāsa](anāvāsa.md)* Pv\-a.80)  
   ■ (nt.) the homeless state (= *anagāriyā*) Snp.376. See also *agga2*.
3. *\-āgāra*: Owing to freq. occurrence of *[agāra](agāra.md)* at the end of compounds of which the first word ends in *[a](a.md)*, we have a dozen quite familiar words ending apparently in *āgāra*. This form has been considered therefore as a proper doublet of *[agāra](agāra.md)*. This however is wrong. The long *[ā](ā.md)* is simply a contraction of the short *[a](a.md)* at the end of the first part of the cpd. with the short *[a](a.md)* at the beginning of *[agāra](agāra.md)* Of the compounds the most common are: *āgantuk˚*; reception hall for strangers or guests SN.iv.219; SN.v.21  
   ■ *itth˚* lady’s bower SN.i.58, SN.i.89  
   ■ *kūṭ˚*; a house with a peaked roof, or with gables SN.ii.103 SN.ii.263; SN.iii.156; SN.iv.186; SN.v.43; AN.i.230; AN.iii.10, AN.iii.364; AN.iv.231; AN.v.21. *\-koṭṭh˚*; storehouse granary DN.i.134 (cp. DN\-a.i.295); SN.i.89. *\-tiṇ˚*; a house covered with grass SN.iv.185; AN.i.101. *\-bhus˚*; threshing shed, barn AN.i.241. *\-santh˚*; a council hall DN.i.91; DN.ii.147; SN.iv.182; SN.v.453; AN.ii.207; AN.iv.179 sq. *\-suññ˚*; an uninhabited shed; solitude SN.v.89, SN.v.157, SN.v.310 sq., SN.v.329 sq. AN.i.241 (variant reading for bhusâgāra); AN.iii.353; AN.iv.139, AN.iv.392, AN.iv.437, AN.v.88, AN.v.109, AN.v.323 sq.

cp. Sk. agāra, probably with the a\-of communion; Gr. ἀγεἱρω to collect, ἀγορά market. Cp. in meaning & etym. gaha1
