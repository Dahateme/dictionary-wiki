*Note* on *[mahā](mahā.md)* & cpds

1. In certain compounds the combn with mahā (mah˚) has become so established & customary (often through politeness in using mahā for the simple term), that the cpd. is felt as an inseparable unity and a sort of “antique” word, in which the 2nd part either does not occur any more by itself or only very rarely, as *mah’ aṇṇava*, which is more freq. than aṇṇava; *mah’ ābhisakka*, where abhisakka does not occur by itself; cp. *mahānubhāva, mahiddhika* *[mahaggha](mahaggha.md)*; or is obscured in its derivation through constant use with mahā, like *[mahesī](mahesī.md)* [mah \+ esī, or īsī] *[mahesakkha](mahesakkha.md)* [mah \+ esakkha]; *[mahallaka](mahallaka.md)* [mah \+ \*ariyaka]; mahāmatta. Cp. E. great\-coat, Gr. ἀρξ˚ in ἀρξ ιατρός = Ger. arzt. Only a limited selection of cpd. words is given, consisting of more frequent or idiomatic terms. Practically *any* word may be enlarged & emphasized in meaning by prefixing; *[mahā](mahā.md)*. Sometimes a mahā˚ lends to special events a standard (historical) significance, so changing the common word into a noun proper, e.g. Mahâbhinikkhammana, Mahāpavāraṇa.
2. *Mahā* occurs in compounds in
   1. an elided form *mah* before *a & i;*
   2. shortened to *maha˚*; before g, d p, b with doubling of these consonants.
   3. in the regular form *mahā˚*: usually before consonants, sometimes before vowels. This form is contracted with foll. *[i](i.md)* to *e* and foll. *[u](u.md)* to *[o](o.md)*. In the foll. list of compounds we have arranged the material according to these bases.
