Vo1

indeclinable a particle of emphasis, perhaps = *[eva](eva.md)*, or = *vo2* (as dative of interest). The Commentaries explain it as “nipāta,” i.e. particle. Thus at Snp.560 Snp.760.

Vo2

is enclitic form of *[tumhe](tumhe.md)* (see under *[tuvaṃ](tuvaṃ.md)*), i.e. to you, of you but it is generally interpreted by the C. as “nipāta, i.e. particle (of emphasis or exclamation; i.e. vo1) Thus e.g. at Pv.i.5#3 (cp. Pv\-a.26).

cp. Vedic vaḥ, Av. vō, Lat. vos, Gr. υ ̓́μμε

Vo˚

is commonly regarded as the prefix combination *vi \+ ava˚*; (i.e. vi \+ o˚), but in many cases it simply represents *[ava˚](ava˚.md)*; (= o˚) with v as euphonic (“vorschlag”), as in vonata (= onata), voloketi, vokkanti, vokiṇṇa, voropeti vosāpeti, vosāna, vossagga. In a few cases it corresponds to *vi \+ ud˚*; as in vokkamati, vocchijjati voyoga.
