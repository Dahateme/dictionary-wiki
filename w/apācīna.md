adjective westerly, backward, below SN.iii.84; Iti.120 (apācīnaṃ used as adv. and taking here the place of adho in combn. with uddhaṃ tiriyaṃ; the reading is a conjecture of Windisch’s, the vv.ll. are apācinaṃ; apācini apāci & apāminaṃ, C. explains by heṭṭhā).

Vedic apācīna; cp. apācaḥ & apāka, western; to Lat. opācus, orig. turned away (from the east or the sun) i.e. opposite, dark
