Pa˚

indeclinable directional prefix of forward motion, in applied sense often emphasising the action as carried on in a marked degree or even beyond its mark (cp. Ger. ver\-in its function of Goth. fra Ger. vor). Thus the sphere of pa\-may be characterised in foll. applications:

1. forth, forward, out: papatati fall forward, i.e. down; ˚neti bring forth (to); ˚gaṇhāti hold out; ˚tharati spread forth; ˚dhāvati run out ˚bajati go forth; ˚sāreti stretch out; etc.
2. (intensive in a marked degree, more than ordinarily (cp. E. up in cut up, heap up, fill up; thus often to be trsld by “up,” or “out,” or “about”): pakopeti up\-set ˚chindati cut up; ˚bhañjati break up; ˚cinati heap up ˚kiṇṇaka scattered about; ˚nāda shouting out; ˚bhāti shine forth; ˚bhavati grow up, prevail; ˚dūseti spoil entirely; ˚jahati give up entirely; ˚tapeti make shine exceedingly (C. ativiya dīpeti); ˚jalati blaze up; ˚jānāti know well  
   ■ In this meaning often with adjectives like patanu very thin; ˚thaddha quite stiff; ˚dakkhiṇa right in pre\-eminence; ˚bala very strong.
3. “onward” paṭṭhāya from… onward; pavattati move on; fig “further, later”: paputta a later (secondary) son, i.e. grandson.
4. “in front of,” “before”: padvāra before the door.
5. Sometimes in trs. (reflexive) use like pakūjin singing out to (each other, cp Ger. besingen an\-rufen)

■ The most frequent combination with other (modifying) prefixes is sam\-ppa; its closest relatives (in meaning 2 especially) are *[ā](ā.md)* and *[pari](pari.md)*. The double (assimilation) p is restored after short vowels, like appadhaṃsiya (a \+ pa˚).
