``` toml
dict_label = "PTS"
word = "ādissa"
summary = "at MN.iii.133 is an imper. pres. meaning “take”, &"
see_also = ["ādiya"]
```

at MN.iii.133 is an imper. pres. meaning “take”, & should probably better be read; *[ādiya](ādiya.md)* (in corresponsion with ādāna). It is not grd. of ādisati, which its form might suggest.
