Patta\-kkhandha

downcast, dejected, disappointed Vin.ii.77 = Vin.iii.162 (trsld “with fallen hearts,” explained as patita, see *Vin. Texts* iii.13); SN.i.124; MN.i.132, MN.i.258; MN.iii.298; AN.iii.57; Ja.v.17; Mil.5.

perhaps patta1 \+ khandha, thus “leaf\- shouldered,” i.e. with shoulders drooping like leaves; the Commentators explain patta as contracted form of patita fallen, thus “with shoulders falling.” We may have to deal with an old misspelling for *[panna](panna.md)* (= pa \+ *nam* bent down, put down), which expln would suit the sense better than any other
