Paha1

neuter flight of steps from which to step down into the water, a ghat (= tittha Bdhgh) DN.i.223. The meaning is uncertain, it is trsld as “accessible” at *Dial.* i.283 (q.v. for further detail). Neumann (*Majjhima translation* i.513) trsls “ganz und gar erloschen (pabhā?). It is not at all improbable to take *pahaṃ* as ppr. of pajahati (as contracted fr. pajahaṃ like pahatvāna for pajahitvāna at Snp.639), thus meaning “giving up entirely.” The same form in the latter meaning occurs at Thag\-a.69 (Tha\-ap.v.3)
