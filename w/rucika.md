(\-˚) adjective belonging to the pleasure (of); only in phrase *añña˚*; being dependent on someone else’s will or under another’s influence, together with *aññadiṭṭhika* and *añña\-khantika* characterizing the various sides of personality (see *[ruci](ruci.md)* 3) with ref. to one’s intellect feeling & will DN.i.187 = MN.i.487. Rhys Davids (*Dial.* i.254) trsls: “holding different views, other things approving themselves to you, setting diff. aims before yourself”; thus differing in interpretation of añña taking it subjectively. Neumann (*Majjhima Übs.* ii.250) quite wrongly: “ohne Deutung, ohne Geduld ohne Hingabe” (without explanation, patience, devotion).
