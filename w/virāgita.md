adjective at Ja.v.96 is not clear. It is said of beautiful women expld by C. as vilagga\-sarīrā, tanumajjhā, i.e. “having slender waists.” Could it be “excited with passion or “exciting passion”? Or could it be an old misreading for *virājita2*? It may also be a distorted *[vilāka](vilāka.md)* (q.v.) or *[vilaggita](vilaggita.md)*.

fr. vi \+ \*rāgeti, Denom. of rāga?
