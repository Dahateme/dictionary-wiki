is not clear; according to Kern,
» Toevoegselen

 s. v. = vīthi \+ antarikā, i.e. space in between two streets or midstreet MN.i.448; AN.i.124. Neumann (*Mittl. Slg.* ii.182) translates “Rinnstein” (i.e. gutter). Under *[antarikā](antarikā.md)* we have given the translation “interval of lightning, thus taking it as *vijju \+ antarikā*. Quoted DN\-a.i.34.

a very bold assumption: vīthy contracted to vijj˚!
