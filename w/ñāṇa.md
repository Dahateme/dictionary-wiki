1. *Ñāṇa in the theory of cognition:*  
   it occurs in intensive couple\-compounds with terms of sight as cakkhu (eye) & dassana (sight, view) e.g. in cakkhu\-karaṇa ñāṇa\-karaṇa “opening our eyes & thus producing knowledge” i.e. giving us the eye of knowledge (a mental eye) ‣See [cakkhu](cakkhu.md), jānāti passati & compound ˚karaṇa: Bhagavā jānaṁ jānāti passaṁ passati cakkhu\-bhūto ñāṇa\-bhūto (= he is one perfected in knowledge) MN.i.111 = Cnd.2353h; natthi hetu natthi paccayo ñāṇāya dassanāya ahetu apaccayo ñāṇaṁ dassanaṁ hoti “through seeing & knowing,” i.e. on grounds of definite knowledge arises the sure conviction that where there is no cause there is no consequence SN.v.126 cp. also the relation of diṭṭhi to ñāṇa. This implies that all things visible are knowable as well as that all our knowledge is based on empirical grounds yāvatakaṁ ñeyyaṁ tāvatakaṁ ñāṇaṁ Cnd.2353m; yaṁ ñāṇaṁ taṁ dassanaṁ, yaṁ dassanaṁ taṁ ñāṇaṁ Vin.iii.91 ñāṇa \+ dassana (i.e. full vision) as one of the characteristics of Arahantship ‣See [arahant](arahant.md) ii.D. cp. Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit jñānadarśana, e.g. Avs.i.210
2. *Scope and character of ñāṇa:*  
   ñ. as faculty of understanding is included in paññā (cp. wisdom = perfected knowledge) The latter signifies the spiritual wisdom which embraces the fundamental truths of morality & conviction (such as aniccaṃ anattā dukkhaṃ: Mil.42); whereas ñ. is relative to common experience (see Cnd.235#3 under cakkhumā, & on rel. of p. & ñ. Pts.i.59 sq.; Pts.i.118 sq. Pts.ii.189 sq.)  
   ■ Perception (saññā) is necessary to the forming of ñāṇa, it precedes it (DN.i.185); as sure knowledge ñ. is preferable to saddhā (SN.iv.298); at Vin.iii.91 the definition of ñ. is given with tisso vijjā (3 kinds of knowledge); they are specified at Cnd.266 as aṭṭhasamāpatti\-ñāṇa (consisting in the 8 attainments, viz jhāna & its 4 succeeding developments), pañc’ abhiññā (the 5 higher knowledges, see *[paññā](paññā.md)* & abhi˚), micchā (false k. or heresy). Three degrees of k. are distinguished at DN\-a.i.100, viz. sāvaka\-pāramī\-ñāṇa, paccekabuddha˚ sabbaññuta˚ (highest k. of a relig. student k. of a wise man, & omniscience). Four objects of k (as objects of truth or sammādiṭṭhi) are enumerated as dhamme ñāṇaṃ, anvaye ñ., paricchede ñ., sammuti ñ at DN.iii.226, DN.iii.277; other four as dukkhe ñ. (dukkha\-samudaye ñ., nirodhe ñ., magge ñ. (i.e. the knowledge of the paṭicca\-samuppāda) at DN.iii.227; Pts.i.118 Vb.235 (= sammādiṭṭhi). Right knowledge (or truth is contrasted with false k. (micchā\-ñāṇa = micchādiṭṭhi): SN.v.384; MN.ii.29; AN.ii.222; AN.v.327; Vb.392.
