Parā˚

prefix prep meaning “on to,” “over” (with the idea of mastering) also “through, throughout.” The ā is shortened before double consonant, like parā \+ *kṛ*; = parakkaroti, parā *kram* = parakkamati (see under compounds of para).

para \+ ā, not instr. of para: see *[para](para.md)* 2 c; in some cases it may also correspond to paraṃ˚
