\-D\-

euphonic consonant inserted to avoid hiatus:

1. orig. only sandhi\-cons. in forms ending in t & d (like tāvat kocid, etc.) & thus restored in compounds where the simplex has lost it:  
   dvipa\-d\-uttama Snp.995; koci\-d\-eva Pv\-a.153; kincid\-eva ibid. Pv\-a.70; tāva\-d\-eva ib. Pv\-a.74; yāva\-d\-atthaṃ ib Pv\-a.217; ahu\-d\-eva Mil.22 etc
2. then also transferred to & replacing other sandhi\-cons. (like puna\-d\-eva for punar eva):  
   puna\-d\-eva Pv.ii.11#3 (variant reading BB); Dhp\-a.ii.76; samma\-d\-eva Snp.p.16; Vv\-a.148; Pv\-a.66 etc.; cp. Snp\-a.284. bahu\-d\-eva Ja.i.170
