adjective & ˚ā feminine

1. turning round swinging round; diffusion, radiation; protuberance, with reference to the rays of the Buddha at Ja.i.12, Ja.i.95, Ja.i.501.
2. (f.) a garland or other ornament slung round & worn over the head Vv.36#2 (kañcan˚; = āveḷa\-pilandhana Vv\-a.167). See *āveḷin*.

not with Müller; *P.Gr.* 10, 30, 37 = Sk. āpīḍa, but fr. ā \+ *veṣṭh* to wind or turn round which in P. is represented by āveṭheti as well as āvijjhati ḷ then standing for either ḍh (ṭh) or dh (āvedha, q.v.) There may have been an analogy influence through *vell* to move to and fro, cp. āveḷita. Müller refers to āveḷā rightly the late dial. (Prk.) āmela
