Avassajati & ossajati

to let loose, let go, send off, give up, dismiss, release (ava) Ja.iv.425; Ja.v.487 (aor. avassaji read for avissaji).

ava \+ *sṛj*, perhaps ud \+ *sṛj* = Sk. utsṛjati, although the usual Vedic form is avasṛjati The form ossajati puzzled the BSk. writers in their sanskritisation apotsṛjati = apa \+ ut \+ *sṛj* Divy.203
