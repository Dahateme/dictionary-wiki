### II. *Meanings* ###

1. The soul as postulated in the animistic theories held in N India in the 6th and 7th cent. B.C. It is described in the Upanishads as a small creature, in shape like a man, dwelling in ordinary times in the heart. It escapes from the body in sleep or trance; when it returns to the body life and motion reappear. It escapes from the body at death, then continues to carry on an everlasting life of its own. For numerous other details see Rh. D. *Theory of Soul in the Upanishads* J.R.A.S. 1899. *Bt. India* 251–⁠255. Buddhism repudiated all such theories, thus differing from other religions. Sixteen such theories about the soul DN.i.31. Seven other theories DN.i.34. Three others DN.i.186–DN.i.186. A ʻsoul’ according to general belief was some thing permanent, unchangeable, not affected by sorrow SN.iv.54 = Kv.67; Vin.i.14; MN.i.138 See also MN.i.233; MN.iii.265, MN.iii.271; SN.ii.17, SN.ii.109; SN.iii.135; AN.i.284; AN.ii.164, AN.ii.171; AN.v.188; SN.iv.400.

But conscience as a unity or entity is not accepted by Buddhism Snp.284; Dhp.166, Dhp.380; Mil.54 (the image, outward appearance, of oneself). Acc. *attānaṃ* SN.i.44 (would not give for himself, as a slave) AN.i.89; Snp.709. Acc. *attaṃ* Dhp.379. Abl. *attato* as oneself SN.i.188; Pts.i.143; Pts.ii.48 Vb.336.
