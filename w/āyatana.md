   ■ *Cpd.* p. 183 says rightly: “āyatana cannot be rendered by a single English word to cover both sense\-organs (the mind being regarded as 6th sense) and sense objects”  
   ■ These āyatanāni (relations, functions reciprocalities) are thus divided into two groups, inner (ajjhattikāni) and outer (bāhirāni), and comprise the foll.:
   1. *ajjhatt˚*: 1. *[cakkhu](cakkhu.md)* eye, 2. *[sota](sota.md)* ear, 3. *[ghāna](ghāna.md)* nose, 4. *[jivhā](jivhā.md)* tongue, 5. *[kāya](kāya.md)* body, 6. *[mano](mano.md)* mind
   2. *bāh˚*: 1. *[rūpa](rūpa.md)* visible object, 2. *[sadda](sadda.md)* sound, 3 *[gandha](gandha.md)* odour, 4. *[rasa](rasa.md)* taste, 5. *[phoṭṭhabba](phoṭṭhabba.md)* tangible object, 6. *[dhamma](dhamma.md)* cognizable object  
      ■ For details as regards connotation & application see Dhs trsl. introduction li sq. *Cpd.* 90 n. 2; 254 sq  
      ■ Approximately covering this meaning (3) is Bdhgh’s definition of āyatana at DN\-a.i.124 as sañjāti and as kāraṇa (origin & cause i.e. mutually occasioning & conditioning relations or adaptations). See also Cnd under rūpa for further classifications.
