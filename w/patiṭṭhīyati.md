to be obdurate, to offer resistance AN.i.124; AN.ii.203; AN.iii.181 sq. Ja.iv.22 (aor. ˚ṭṭhīya); Pp.36; Kp\-a.226.

only apparently (Pass.) to patiṭṭhahati, of *sthā*, but in reality = Sk. prati\-sthyāyate, of *sthyā*, see *[thīna](thīna.md)*. Ought to be paṭitthīyati; but was by popular analogy with patiṭṭhāya changed to patiṭṭhīyati
