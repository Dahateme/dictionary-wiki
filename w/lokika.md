Lokiya & lokika

(adj.)

1. (ordinarily) “belonging to the world,” i.e
   1. world\-wide, covering the whole world, famed, widely known Thag.554; Ja.vi.198.
   2. (\-˚) belonging to the world of, an inhabitant of (as *[lokika](lokika.md)*) Pv.i.6#2 (Yama˚)
   3. common, general worldly Vism.89 (samādhi); Dhp\-a.iv.3 (˚mahājana Pv\-a.131 (˚parikkhaka), Pv\-a.207 (sukha), Pv\-a.220 (˚sabhāva) See also below 3.

2. (special meaning) worldly mundane, when opposed to *[lokuttara](lokuttara.md)*. The term *[lokuttara](lokuttara.md)* has *two* meanings\-viz.
   1. in ordinary sense the highest of the world, best, sublime (like lokagga etc.), often applied to Arahantship, e.g. *lokuttaradāyajja* inheritance of Arahantship Ja.i.91; Dhp\-a.i.117 ideal: *lokuttara dhamma* (like parama dhamma) the ideal state, viz. Nibbāna MN.ii.181; pl. l. *[dhammā](dhammā.md)* MN.iii.115
   2. (in later canonical literature) beyond these worlds, supra\-mundane, transcendental, spiritual In this meaning it is applied to the group of *nava lokuttarā dhammā* (viz. the 4 stages of the Path sotāpatti etc., with the 4 phala’s, and the addition of nibbāna), e.g. Dhs.1094. Mrs. Rh. D. tries to compromise between the two meanings by giving lokuttara the translation “engaged upon the higher ideal” (*Dhs. tsrl.* introduction p. 98), since meaning (b) has too much of a one\-sided philosophical appearance.
