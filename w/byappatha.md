busy, active. Thus Kern, but the translation is not satisfactory. It occurs only at 2 passages; Vin.iv.2 where combined with vācā, girā, vacībheda, and meaning “mode of speech,” and at Snp.961, where it has the same meaning & is referred by Mnd.472 to a mode of speech & expld by Snp\-a.572 by *[vacana](vacana.md)*. Thus the derivation fr. *pṛ*; with vyā˚ can hardly be claimed to be correct for Bdhgh’s conception of the word; to him it sounded more likely like vy \+ ā \+ patha (cp. cpds vacana\-patha & vāda\-patha), thus “way of speaking.”

so for byappattha; according to Kern,
» Toevoegselen

 s. v. the word is a distortion fr. *\*vyāpṛta* (for which usually P. *[vyāvaṭa](vyāvaṭa.md)*) of vy \+ ā \+ pṛ3, pṛṇoti to be busy or active
