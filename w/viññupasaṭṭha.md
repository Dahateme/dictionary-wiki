unattacked, not deficient, unmolested, undisturbed: is Kern’s (
» Toevoegselen

 s. v.) proposed reading for *viññū\-pasattha* (“extolled by the wise”) at SN.ii.70 (reads ṭṭh); SN.v.343; DN.ii.80; DN.iii.245: all identical passages. We consider Kern’s change unnecessary: *anupasaṭṭha* would have been the most natural expression if it had been meant in the sense suggested by Kern.
