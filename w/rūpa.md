form, figure, appearance, principle of form, etc.

1. *Definitions.* According to P. expositors rūpa takes its designation fr. *[ruppati](ruppati.md)*, e.g. “ruppanato rūpaṃ” Vism.588; “ruppan’ aṭṭhena r.” Vb\-a.3; “rūpa\-rūpaṃ ruppana sabhāvena yuttaṃ” *Cpd.* 1567 (where *[ruppati](ruppati.md)* is, not quite correctly, given as “change”), “ruppatī ti: tasmā rūpan ti vuccati” SN.iii.86; other defns are “rūpayatī ti rūpaṃ” (with cakkhu & the other 10 āyatanas) Vb\-a.45; and more scientifically: “paresu rūp’ ādisu cakkhu\-paṭihanana lakkhaṇaṃ rūpaṃ Vism.446  
   ■ Of modern interpretations & discussions see e.g. ; *Dhs. trsl.* introd. ch. vi. (pp. 41–⁠63, or 248–71) *Dial.* ii.244; *Expos.* 67n; *Cpd.* 270 sq. (where objections are raised to translation “form,” and as better (philosophical) terms “matter,” “material quality” are recommended). See also *[loka](loka.md)* for similar etym
2. (lit.) appearance, form, figure Dhs.597 sq. (= form either contrasted with what is unseen, or taken for both seen and unseen), 751; Mhvs.27, Mhvs.30 (sīha\-vyagghādirūpāni representations of lions, tigers etc.); Mhvs.30, Mhvs.68 (ravicanda\-tāra\-rūpāni id.); Mhvs.36, Mhvs.31 (loha˚ bronze statue) Thag\-a.257  
   ■ Esp. beautiful form, beauty SN.iv.275; Pv.ii.9#58 (as one of the 10 attributes, with sadda etc. of distinction: see also below DN ii.a); Mil.285; Mhvs.20, Mhvs.4 (rūpa\-māninī proud of her beauty); Pv\-a.89\- *[surūpa](surūpa.md)* very beautiful Thag\-a.72; *durūpa* of evil form ugly AN.ii.203 sq. (dubbaṇṇa \+)  
   ■ In phrase *rūpaṃ sikkhati* Vin.i.77 = Vin.iv.129 the meaning is doubtful; it may be “to study drawing, or arts & craft,” or (with Mrs. Rh. D.) “weights & measures,” or (w. Hardy “money changing.” It is said that through this occupation the eyes become bad; it is opposed to *[gaṇanā](gaṇanā.md)*
3. (\-˚) of such & such a form, like, kind, of a certain condition or appearance. In this appln very frequent & similar to E \-hood, or Ger \-heit, i.e. an abstract formation Often untranslatable because of the latter character. It is similar to; *[kāya](kāya.md)* (cp. expln of ātura *[rūpa](rūpa.md)* Vv.83#14 by abhitunna *\-[kāya](kāya.md)* Vv\-a.328), but not so much with ref. to life & feeling as to appearance and looks. E.g. aneka˚ Snp.1079 (= anekavidha Cnd.54) adissamāna˚ invisible Pv\-a.6 (lit. with invisible form) ummatta˚ as if mad, under the appearance of madness like a madman Pv.i.8#1; Pv.ii.6#3; eva˚ in such a condition Pv.ii.1#5; tapassī˚ appearing to be an ascetic Pv.i.3#2 tāraka˚ the (shapes of the) stars Dhs.617; deva˚ as a deva Pv\-a.92. *Pleonastically* e.g. in: anupatta˚ attaining Pv.iv.1#66; taramāna˚ quickly Pv.ii.6#2; yutta˚ fit Pv\-a.157; sucitta˚ variegated Pv.i.10#9  
   ■ Cases *ad verbially:* citta *\-rūpaṃ* *according* to intention Vin.iii.161 Vin.iv.177; cetabba\-rūpaṃ fit to be thought upon Ja.iv.157 (= ˚yuttakaṃ C.)  
   ■ atta *\-rūpena* on my own account SN.iv.97; godha\- *rūpena* as an iguana Mhvs.28, Mhvs.9
4. (as philos. t. t.) principle of (material) form, materiality visibility  
   ■ There are var. groups of psychological and metaphysical systematizations, in which rūpa functions as the *material*, gross factor, by the side of other, more subtle factors. In all these representations of rūpa we find that an element of moral psychology overshadows the purely philosophical & speculative aspect. A detailed (Abhidhammatic) discussion of rūpa in var. aspects is to be found at Dhs § 585–980.
   1. rūpa as *[āyatana](āyatana.md)* or sense object. It is the object of the activity or sphere of the organ of sight (cakkhu) As such it heads the list of the 6 bāhirāni āyatanāni (see e.g. Cnd.p.238 A\-E & āyatana3) with “cakkhunā rūpaṃ disvā” (the others: sota → sadda, ghāna → gandha jivhā → rasa, kāya → phoṭṭhabba, mano → dhamma), *cp.* cakkhu\-viññeyyā rūpā iṭṭhā kantā etc. DN.i.245; MN.i.266 cakkhunā rūpaṃ passati iṭṭha\-rūpaṃ kanta\-rūpaṃ etc SN.iv.126  
      ■ see further: Vin.i.34 (sabbaṃ ādittaṃ cakkhuṃ ādittaṃ, rūpa ādittā etc. with sequence of other āyatanas); DN.ii.308 sq., DN.ii.336 sq.; MN.iii.18 (yaṃ kho rūpaṃ paṭicca uppajjati sukhaṃ somanassaṃ, ayaṃ rūpe assādo; cp. Pts.ii.109 sq.), MN.iii.291 (ye te cakkhu\-viññeyyesu rūpesu avīta\-rāgā etc.); Pts.i.79; Pts.ii.38 (rūpī rūpāni passatī ti vimokkho); Dhs.617, Dhs.653, Dhs.878; Tikp.28.
   2. (metaphysically) as the representative of sensory or material existence:
      1. universally as forming the corporeal stratum in the world of appearance or form (*rūpa\-* bhava) as compared with the incorporeal (*[arūpa](arūpa.md)* \-bhava) being itself above, and yet including the *kāma\-* bhava (The kāmabhava is a subdivision of rūpabhava, which has got raised into a third main division.) This triad is also found in combinations with *[loka](loka.md)* or *[dhātu](dhātu.md)* (see *[dhātu](dhātu.md)* 2 a & d), or; *[avacara](avacara.md)*. See e.g. DN.i.17; DN.iii.215 (˚dhātu), DN.iii.216 (˚bhava); Kv.370 sq. (˚dhātu); Dhs.499 (˚âvacara), Dhs.585 (˚dhātu); Vb.17 (˚āvacara), Vb.25 (as garu\-pariṇāma & dandha\-nirodha compd with arūpa). A similar sequence *rūpa arūpa & nirodha;* (i.e. nibbāna) in old verses at Snp.755; Iti.45, Iti.62 (rūpehi arūpā santatarā arūpehi nirodho santataro). On indriya\-rūpa “faculty as form” see *[indriya](indriya.md)* B
      2. individually in the sphere of saṃsāra as one (i.e. the material quality) of the substrata of sensory individual existence or the khandhas They are the 5: rūpa\-kkhandha, vedanā˚ saññā˚, sankhārā˚, viññāṇa˚; otherwise called *rūp ūpādāna\-kkhandha* etc. (e.g. DN.iii.223, DN.iii.278; Vism.443) See khandha ii. B  
         ■ In this property rūpa consists of 28 subdivisions, viz. the 4 (great) dhātūs (mahābhūtāni or else bhūta\-rūpa primary matter) and 24 upādārūpāni (i.e. derivative forms or accidentals). These are given *in extenso* in the rūpakkhandha section of the Vism (pp. 443–450), also at Dhs.585; the 24 consist of cakkhu, sota, ghāna, jivhā, kāya, rūpa, sadda, gandha rasa, itthindriya, purisindriya, jīvitindriya, hadaya vatthu, *[kāya](kāya.md)* \-viññatti, vacī\-viññatti, ākāsa\-dhātu (rūpassa) lahutā mudutā kammaññatā, upacaya santati jaratā aniccatā, kabaḷinkār’\-āhāra; cp. defn at Ne.73: cātu\-mahābhūtikaṃ rūpaṃ catunnaṃ ca mahābhūtānaṃ upādāya rūpassa paññatti. The *rūpakkhandha* shares with the others the qualities of *soullessness, evanescence* and *ill* (anattā, anicca dukkha); e.g. rūpañ ca h’ idaṃ attā abhavissa, na y’ idaṃ rūpaṃ ābadhāya saṃvatteyya Vin.i.13, cp similarly MN.iii.282 sq.; SN.iii.66; quoted and explained in detail at Vism.610; rūpaṃ aniccaṃ Vin.i.14; MN.i.228 MN.iii.18 (see [explained at Vism.610](explained at Vism.610.md)); SN.iii.48, SN.iii.66, SN.iii.88; rūpe anicc’ ânupassanā Pts.ii.186 sq  
         ■ See also DN.ii.301 DN.iii.233; Pts.i.23, Pts.i.53, Pts.i.104; Pts.ii.96, Pts.ii.102, Pts.ii.109 (rūpassa ādīnavo); Vb.1. sq., 12 sq. (in detail); Kv.11 sq. Vism.443 sq.; Tikp.33; Vb\-a.2, Vb\-a.3, Vb\-a.32 sq. = SN.iii.142 (with var. similes); Dhp\-a.iv.100
      3. in the making up of the individuality as such (*nāma\-rūpa*), where in contrast with *[nāma](nāma.md)* (as abstract, logical, invisible or mind\-factor) *[rūpa](rūpa.md)* represents the visible (material factor, resembling *[kāya](kāya.md)* (cp. phrase nāma\-kāya in same sense). The foll. are current defns of *nāma\-rūpa nāma\-(kāya)* = vedanā, saññā, cetanā, phassa, manasikāra (otherwise citta\-sankhārā), *rūpa(\-kāya)* = cattāro mahā\-bhūtā catunnaṃ m\-bhūtānaṃ upādāya rūpaṃ (otherwise kāya\-sankhārā) SN.ii.4; SN.iii.59 sq.; Pts.i.183 with explains at Vism.558 & Vb\-a.169. Defined at Ne.15: “ye phassa\-pañcamakā dhammā: idaṃ nāmaṃ yāni pañc’ indriyāni rūpāni: idaṃ rūpaṃ, tad ubhayaṃ nāmarūpaṃ viññāṇa\-sampayuttaṃ.” Discussed in detail also at Vism.562 (= Vb\-a.173, Vb\-a.174), 587–597; cp Dhs\-a.392 (*Expos.* 500, where “mind\-matter” is given as corresp. couple in translation, do. *Cpd.* 271 sq. “mind and body”).
