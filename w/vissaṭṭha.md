1. let loose; sent (out); released, dismissed; thrown; given out Mhvs.10, Mhvs.68; Ja.i.370; Ja.iii.373; Pv\-a.46, Pv\-a.64, Pv\-a.123, Pv\-a.174.
2. (of the *voice.*) distinct, well enunciated DN.i.114 (= apalibuddha, i.e. unobstructed; sandiddha\-vilambit’ ādi dosa\-rahita DN\-a.i.282); DN.ii.211; AN.ii.51; AN.iii.114; SN.i.189; Ja.vi.16 (here as *[vissattha](vissattha.md)* \-vacana).
3. vissaṭṭha at Ja.iv.219 in phrase *\-indriya* means something like “strong,” distinguished. The variant reading *visatta˚*; suggests a probable *visaṭa˚*; it may on the other hand be a corruption of *visiṭṭha˚*.
