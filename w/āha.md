perfect in meaning of pret. & pres. “he says or he said” he spoke, also spoke to somebody (w. acc.), as at Ja.i.197 (cullalohitaṃ āha). Usually in 3rd person, very rarely used of 2nd person, as at Snp.839, Snp.840 (= kathesi bhaṇasi Nd.188, Nd.191).

3rd sg. *[āha](āha.md)* Vin.ii.191; Snp.790 (= bhaṇati Mnd.87), Snp.888; Ja.i.280; Ja.iii.53 and freq. passim; 3rd pl *[āhu](āhu.md)* Snp.87, Snp.181; Dhp.345; Ja.i.59; Snp\-a.377, and *āhaṃsu* Ja.i.222; Ja.iii.278 and freq.

Vedic āha, orig. perfect of *ah* to speak, meaning “he began to speak”, thus in meaning of pres. “he says”
