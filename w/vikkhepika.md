# vikkhepika

``` toml
dict_label = "PTS"
word = "vikkhepika"
summary = "adjective , in phrase amarā˚: see under amarā; ano"
see_also = ["amarā"]
```

adjective , in phrase *amarā˚*: see under *[amarā](amarā.md)*; another suggestion as to explanation may be: khipa = eel\-basket, thus vikhep\-ika one who upsets the eel\-basket, i.e. causes confusion.

fr. vikkhepa
