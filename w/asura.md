fallen angel, a Titan pl. *asurā* the Titans, a class of mythological beings. Dhpāla at Pv\-a.272 & the C. on Ja.v.186 define them as kāḷakañjaka\-bhedā asurā. The are classed with other similar inferior deities, e.g. with garuḷā, nāgā, yakkhā at Mil.117; with supaṇṇā, gandhabbā, yakkhā at DN\-a.i.51. The fight between Gods & Titans is also reflected in the oldest books of the Pāli Canon and occurs in identical description at the foll. passages under; *the title of devāsura\-saṅgāma*: DN.ii.285; SN.i.222 (cp. SN.i.216 sq.), SN.iv.201 sq., SN.v.447; MN.i.253; AN.iv.432  
■ Rebirth as an Asura is considered as one of the *four unhappy rebirths* or evil fates after death (apāyā; viz. niraya, tiracchāna\-yoni, petā or pettivisaya, asurā), e.g. at Iti.93; Ja.v.186; Pv.iv.11#1 see also *[apāya](apāya.md)*  
■ Other passages in general: SN.i.216 sq (fight of Devas & Asuras); iv.203; AN.ii.91; AN.iv.198 sq. AN.iv.206; Snp.681; Mnd.89, Mnd.92, Mnd.448; Dhp\-a.i.264 (˚kaññā) Sdhp.366, Sdhp.436.

* *\-[inda](inda.md)* Chief or king of the Titans. Several Asuras are accredited with the rôle of leaders, most commonly Vepacitti (SN.i.222; SN.iv.201 sq.) and Rāhu (AN.ii.17, AN.ii.53; AN.iii.243) Besides these we find Pahārāda (gloss Mahābhadda) at AN.iv.197.
