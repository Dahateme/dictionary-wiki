or ˚ā feminine tumbling, turning somersaults, an acrobatic feat; in list of forbidden amusements at DN.i.6 (cp. DN\-a.i.86; samparivattaka\-kīḷanaṃ, i.e. playing with something that rolls along, continuously turning The foll. sentence however seems to imply turning head over heels: “ākāse vā daṇḍaṃ gahetvā bhūmiyaṃ vā sīsaṃ ṭhapetvā heṭṭh\-upariya (so read!)\-bhāvena parivattana\-kīḷanaṃ”; i.e. trapeze\-performing. Cp *Dial.* i.10 & *Vin. Texts* ii.184). The list re\-occurs at Vin.ii.10 (˚āya: f.! kīḷanti); Vin.iii.180; MN.i.266≈and AN.v.203 (with important variant reading mokkhaṭika, which would imply *[mokkha](mokkha.md)* & ending; *tiya*, and not *\-cika* at all The Cy. on this passage explains as: daṇḍakaṃ gahetvā heṭṭh\-uppariya (*sic.* as DN\-a.i.86; correct to upariya?\-bhāvena parivattana\-kīḷanaṃ). The word is found also at Vin.i.275, where the boy of a Seṭṭhi in Bārāṇasī contracts injuries to his intestines by “mokkhacikāya kīḷanto,” playing (with a) m  
■ According to its use with *[kīḷati](kīḷati.md)* & in instr.; *mokkhacikena* (Cnd.219 may be either a sort of game or an instrument (toy) with which children play.

see on attempt at etym. Morris in *J.P.T.S.* 1885, 49 who takes mokkha as fr. *muc* “tumbling” & cika = “turning” fr. *cak = cik*. The word remains obscure, it must be a dialectical expression distorted by popular analogy & taken perhaps; from a designation of a place where these feats or toys had their origin. More probable than Morris’ etym is an analysis of the word (if it *is* Aryan) as mokkha mokkha2, in meaning “head, top,” so that it may mean “head over,” top\-first” & we have to separate \*mokkhac\-ika the ˚ika representing ˚iya “in the manner of like” & *\-ac* being the adv. of direction as contained in Sk. prāñc = pra\-añc.
