one who feels (or senses) that which can be felt (or sensed), in phrase “mutaṃ na maññati *motabbaṃ* (so read) na maññati motāraṃ” he does not identify what is sensed with that which is not sensed nor with what is *to be sensed* (*motabba*) nor with him who senses AN.ii.25; where motar & motabba correspond to sotar & sotabba & daṭṭhar & daṭṭhabba. The word does not occur in the similar passage MN.i.3.

n. ag. fr. munāti, more likely direct der. fr. muta, pp. of *man*, q.v.
