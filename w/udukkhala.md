``` toml
dict_label = "PTS"
word = "udukkhala"
summary = "mortar Vin.i.202 (+ musala pestle); Ja.i.502; Ja.i"

```

mortar Vin.i.202 (\+ musala pestle); Ja.i.502; Ja.ii.428; Ja.v.49; Ja.ii.161, Ja.ii.335; Ud.69 (m; \+ musaḷa); Dhp\-a.ii.131 (˚sala); Vism.354 (in comp.). The relation between *[udukkhala](udukkhala.md)* and *[musala](musala.md)* is seen best from the description of eating at Vism.344 and DN\-a.i.200, where the lower teeth play the role of *ud.* the upper teeth act as *m.*, while the tongue takes the part of a hand. On this passage & other connections as well as etym. see Morris; J.P.T.S. 1893, 37.
