1. strewn over, beset with, crowded, full of, dense, rich in (˚\-) Vin.iii.130 (˚loma with dense hair); SN.i.204 (˚kammanta “in motley tasks engaged”), SN.iv.37 (gāmanto ā. bhikkhūhi etc.); AN.iii.104 (˚vihāro), AN.iv.4; AN.v.15 (an˚ C. for appakiṇṇa); Snp.408 (˚varalakkhaṇa = *vipula\-* varalakkh˚ Snp\-a.383); Pv.ii.12#4 (nānā\-dijagaṇ = āyutta Pv\-a.157); Pp.31; Pv\-a.32 (= parikiṇṇa) Sdhp.595  
   ■ Freq. in idiomatic phrase describing a flourishing city “iddha phīta bahujana ākiṇṇa\-manussa” e.g. DN.i.211; DN.ii.147 (˚yakkha for ˚manussa; full of yakkhas i.e. under their protection); AN.iii.215; cp. Mil.2 (˚jana\-manussa).
2. (uncertain whether to be taken as above (1) or as equal to avakiṇṇa fr. avakirati 2) dejected, base, vile, ruthless SN.i.205 = Ja.iii.309 = Ja.iii.539 = Snp\-a.383 At *K. S.* 261, Mrs. Rh. D. translates “ruthless” & quotes C. as implying twofold exegesis of (a) impure, and (b) hard, ruthless. It is interesting to notice that Bdhgh explains the same verse differently at Snp\-a.383, viz. by; *vipula˚*; as above under Snp.408, & takes ākiṇṇaludda as vipulaludda, i.e. beset with cruelty, very or intensely cruel, thus referring it to ākiṇṇa 1.
