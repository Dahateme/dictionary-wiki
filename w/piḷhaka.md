(variant reading *[miḷhakā](miḷhakā.md)*) at SN.ii.228 is to be read as *[mīḷhakā](mīḷhakā.md)* “cesspool” (q.v.). The C. quoted on p. 228 explains incorrectly by “kaṃsalak’ ādi gūthapāṇakā,” which would mean “a low insect breeding in excrements (thus perhaps = paṭanga?). The trsl. (*K.S.* ii.155) has “dung\-beetle.”
