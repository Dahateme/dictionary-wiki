Acci\-bandha

adjective at Vin.i.287 is expld. by Bdhgh as caturassa\-kedāra\-baddha (“divided into short pieces” Vin Texts ii.207), i.e. with squares of irrigated fields. The vv.ll. are acca˚ and acchi˚, and we should prefer the conjecture *acchi\-baddha* “in the shape of cubes or dice”, i.e. with square fields.

= accibaddha?
