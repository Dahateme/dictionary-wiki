Aṇḍaka1

neuter = aṇḍa, egg Dhp\-a.i.60; Dhp\-a.iii.137 (sakuṇ˚).

Aṇḍaka2

adjective only used of vācā speech: harsh, rough, insolent MN.i.286; AN.v.265, AN.v.283 AN.v.293 (gloss kaṇṭakā); Ja.iii.260; Dhs.1343, cp. Dhs\-a.396.

Sk.? prob. an inorganic form; the diaeresis of caṇḍaka into c˚ aṇḍaka seems very plausible. As to meaning cp. Dhs\-a.396 and see *Dhs trsl.* 349, also Morris J. P. T. S. 1893, 6, who, not satisfactorily, tries to establish a relation to *ard*, as in aṭṭa3
