the body in being, the existing body or group (= *\-[nikāya](nikāya.md)* q.v.); as a t.t. in P. psychology almost equal to *individuality;* identified with the five khandhas MN.i.299; SN.iii.159; SN.iv.259; AN.ii.34; Thig.170, Thig.239; Dhs\-a.348. See also DN.iii.216 (cp. *Dial.* Pv.iii.216#1); AN.iii.293, AN.iii.401; Mnd.109.

*\-[diṭṭhi](diṭṭhi.md)* theory of soul, heresy of individuality, speculation as to the eternity or otherwise of one’s own individuality MN.i.300 = MN.iii.17 = DhS.1003, SN.iii.16 sq In these passages this is explained as the belief that in one or other of the khandhas there is a permanent entity an attā. The same explanation, at greater length, in the Diṭṭhigata Sutta (Pts.i.143–Pts.i.151). As delusions about the soul or ghost can arise out of four sorts of bias (see *[abhinivesa](abhinivesa.md)*) concerning each of the five khandhas we have *twenty* kinds of s˚ diṭṭhi: fifteen of these are kinds of *sakkāya\-vatthukā sassata\-diṭṭhi*, and five are kinds of *s˚\-vatthukā uccheda\-diṭṭhi* (ibid. 149, 150) Gods as well as men are *s˚ pariyāpannā* SN.iii.85; and so is the eye, Dhs\-a.308. When the word *[diṭṭhi](diṭṭhi.md)* is not expressed it is often implied, Thig.199, Thig.339; Snp.231 S˚ diṭṭhi is the first Bond to be broken on entering the Path (see *[saṃyojana](saṃyojana.md)*); it is identical with the fourth kind of Grasping (see *[upādāna](upādāna.md)*); it is opposed to Nibbāna, SN.iv.175; is extinguished by the Path, MN.i.299; SN.iii.159; SN.iv.260; and is to be put away by insight Dhs\-a.346
