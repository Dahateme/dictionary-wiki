```

indeclinable a part. of exclamation, mostly implying contempt, or deprecation (DN\-a.i.276) “hīḷanavasena āmantanaṃ” i.e. address of disdain: heigh, go on, get away, hallo  
■ DN.i.96, DN.i.107; Ja.iii.184 (C. = āmantaṇe nipāto); often combined with similar particles of exhortation, like *cara pi re* get away with you! MN.ii.108; Vin.iv.139 (so read for cara *[pire](pire.md)* which the C. takes as “*[para](para.md)*,” amamaka); or *ehi re* come on then! Ja.i.225; *ha re* look out! here they are Pv\-a.4; *aho vata re* wish I would! Pv.ii.9#45 (re ti ālapanaṃ Pv\-a.131); *no ca vata re vattabbe* but indeed good sir… (Kv.1).

shortened for *[are](are.md)*, q.v.
