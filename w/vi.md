indeclinable

### I. ###

1. inseparable prefix of separation and expansion, in original meaning of “asunder,” semantically closely related to Lat. dis\- & Ger ver\-. Often as base\-prefix in var meanings (see below 1–⁠4), also very frequent as modifying prefix (in combn with other primary prefixes like ā ni, pa, paṭi, saṃ), where its prevailing character is one of emphasis
2. The native grammarians define *vi\-* either as “*[vividha](vividha.md)*” (i.e. our meaning 2): see Bdhgh at Snp\-a.136 (viharati = vividhaṃ hitaṃ harati); and Vism.179 vividhaṃ khittaṃ = vikkhittaṃ; see also under viggaṇhati; or “*prātilomya*” (i.e. meaning 3) Nirukta (ed. Roth), i.3; or paraphrase it by *su˚*; or *[suṭṭhu](suṭṭhu.md)* (i.e. meaning 4): see under *[vimāna](vimāna.md)* & vippasanna The latter meaning also in Hemacandra’s Anek’ ārtha\-sangraha (ed. Calc.), 7, 15: “śreṣṭhe *’tīte* nānārthe” (i.e. Nos. 4 & 2)
3. *vi˚*; occurs also as *distributive* (repetitional) prefix in reduplication compounds (here closely resembling paṭi˚ and the negative a˚), like cuṇṇa\-vicuṇṇa piecemeal, chidda\-vicchidda holes upon holes, vaṭṭa\-vivaṭṭa, etc.

■ Contracted forms are *[vy˚](vy˚.md)*; (= viy˚ before vowels) and *[vo˚](vo˚.md)*; (= vi ava); the guṇa & vriddhi form is; *[ve˚](ve˚.md)*
