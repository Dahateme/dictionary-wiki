is a word peculiar to the *Jātaka.* At one passage it is explained by the Commentary as “vedi” (i.e. rail, cornice), where it is applied to the slender waist of a woman (cp. *vilāka & vilaggita;*): Ja.vi.456. At most of the other passages it is explained as “a heap of gold” thus at Ja.v.506 (verse: velli\-vilāka\-majjhā; C.: “ettha *vellī* ti *[rāsi](rāsi.md)* vilākamajjhā ti vilagga\-majjhā uttattaghana\-suvaṇṇa *\-[rāsi](rāsi.md)* \-ppabhā c’ eva tanu\-dīgha\-majjhā ca”), and Ja.vi.269 (verse: kañcana\-velli\-viggaha; C. “suvaṇṇa *\-[rāsi](rāsi.md)* \-sassirīka\-sarīrā”). At Ja.v.398 in the same passage as Ja.vi.269 explained in C. as “kañcana\-rūpakasadisa\-sarīrā”). The idea of *“golden”* is connected with it throughout.
