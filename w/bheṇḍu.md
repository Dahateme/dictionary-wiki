ball, bead; also a ball\-shaped ornament or turret, cupola Thag.164 (see *[kaṇḍu](kaṇḍu.md)*2) Ja.i.386 (see [˚maya ball\-shaped](˚maya ball\-shaped.md)); Ja.iii.184 (variant reading geṇḍu).

with variant reading geṇḍu, of uncertain reading & meaning. Pischel, *Prk. Gr.* § 107 gives giṇḍu & remarks that this cannot be derived fr. kaṇḍuka (although; *[kaṇḍu](kaṇḍu.md)* may be considered as gloss of bheṇḍu at Thag.164: see *[kaṇḍu](kaṇḍu.md)*2), but belongs with Prk. geṇḍui play & P geṇḍuka and the originally Sk. words genduka, ginduka geṇḍu, geṇḍuka to a root; *gid, giḍ*, Prk. giṇḍai to play Morris, *J.P.T.S.* 1884, 90 says: “I am inclined to read geṇḍu in all cases & to compare it with geḍuka & geṇḍuka a ball”
