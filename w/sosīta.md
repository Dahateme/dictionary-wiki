at Ja.i.390 means either “thoroughly chilled” or “well wetted.” It is explained as “him’odakena su\-sīto suṭṭhu tinto.” Perhaps we have to read *so sīta*, or *[sīna](sīna.md)* (cp. sīna2), or *[sinna](sinna.md)*. The corresponding *[sotatta](sotatta.md)* (explained as “suriya\-santāpena su\-tatto”) should then be *so tatto*.
