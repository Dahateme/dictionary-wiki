an army Ja.ii.22; cam큰pati a general Mhvs.10, Mhvs.65; Mhvs.23, Mhvs.4; D훮vs i.3.

Both derivation and exact meaning uncertain. The Vedic cam큰 is a peculiar vessel into wh. the Soma flows from the press. In late Pali & Sk. it means a kind of small army, perhaps a division drawn up more or less in the shape of the Vedic vessel
