\-Y\-

combination consonant (sandhi), inserted (euphonically) between 2 vowels for the avoidance of hiatus. It has arisen purely phonetically from *i* as a sort of “gliding or semi\-vowel within a word, where the syllable division was in regular speech more openly felt than in the written language, e.g. pari\-y\-āpanna (Pāli) corresponds to Sk. pary\-āpanna, similarly pari\-y\-osāna = Sk paryosāna. Thus inserted after *a* before *i* or *e:* chay\-imā disā DN.iii.188; ta\-y\-idaṃ Snp.1077; Pv.i.3#3 tava\-y\-idaṃ Snp.352; na\-y\-idaṃ SN.ii.278; mama\-y\-idaṃ Snp.806; na\-y\-idha Snp.790; mā\-y\-idha Vin.i.54; yassay\-etādisī pajā DN.ii.267 (variant reading ss for T yassa\-s\-etādisī) satiyā\-y\-etaṃ adhivacanaṃ MN.ii.260; na\-y\-imassa Pv.iv.1#2  
■ After *i* before *a:* pāvisi\-y\-assamaṃ Ja.v.405 khaṇi\-y\-asmani Ja.iii.433; yā\-y\-aññaṃ Ja.i.429 (where C. explains: ya\-kāro paṭisandhi\-karo)  
■ Cp. yeva for eva  
■ *Note.* At Ja.vi.106 ya\-y\-ime jane is to be taken as *ye ime* jane; the spelling *ay* for *e* being found elsewhere as well. Cp. the following ta\-y\-ime jane.
