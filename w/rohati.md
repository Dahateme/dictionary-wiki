for the Sk. rohati of *ruh* to grow we find the regular P. correspondent *[rūhati](rūhati.md)*: see *[rūhati](rūhati.md)*1. The Caus. of this verb is *[ropeti](ropeti.md)* (to make grow): see *[ropeti](ropeti.md)*. Another root, restricted to the Pāli, is seen in *rūhati2* (with pp. rūḷha) and is equal to *rundh* (rudh rumbh) to break. The Caus. of this root (*ropeti2*) is either an indirect formation from it or (more likely) a direct representative of *rup = lup* as in P *[lumpati](lumpati.md)*. To the latter belong the prep. compounds oropeti & voropeti.
