great desire, greed, excessive longing, insatiability Ja.iv.5, Ja.iv.327.

Sk. \*atṛptyā, a \+ tṛpt \+ yā, influenced by Desid. titṛpsati, so that atricchā phonetically rather corresponds to a form \*a\- tṛpsyā (cch = psy, cp. P. chāta Sk. psāta). For the simple Sk. tṛpti see *[titti](titti.md)* (from tappati2). According to Kern, but phonetically hardly justifiable it is Sk. atīccha = ati \+ icchā “too much desire” with r in dissolution of geminated tt, like atraja for attaja. See also atriccha adj. and cp. J.P.T.S. 1884, 69
