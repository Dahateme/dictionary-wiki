at Dhs\-a.259 and Vism.26 is a grammarian’s construction, abstracted from f. abstr. words ending in *\-āyanā*, e.g. kankhā → kankhāyanā, of which the correct expln. is a derivation fr. caus  
■ formation kankhāyati → kankhāy \+ a \+ nā. What the idea of Bdhgh. was in propounding his expln. is hard to say, perhaps he related it to i and understood it to be the same as *āyāna*.
