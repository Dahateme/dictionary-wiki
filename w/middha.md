torpor, stupidity, sluggishness DN.i.71 (thīna˚) Snp.437; AN.v.18; Dhs.1157; Mil.299, Mil.412 (appa˚ not slothful, i.e. diligent, alert); Vism.450 (˚rūpa; \+ rogarūpa, jātirūpa, etc., in def. of rūpa); DN\-a.i.211 (explained as cetasika gelañña: see on this passage *Dhs trsl.* §1155) Sdhp.459  
■ See *[thīna](thīna.md)*.

orig. pp. perhaps to Vedic *mid* (?) to be fat = *medh*, as Dhs\-a.378 gives “medhatī ti middhaṃ  
■ More likely however connected with Sk. methi (pillar = Lat. meta), cp. Prk. medhi. The meaning is more to the point too, viz. “stiff.” Thus semantically identical with thīna  
■ BSk. also middha, e.g. Divy.555
