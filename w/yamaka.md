1. (adj.) double, twin; only in foll. combinations: *\-pāṭihāriya (& ˚hīra);* the miracle of the double appearances, a miracle performed by the Buddha in Sāvatthī to refute the heretical teachers (cp. Vin.iii.332 Samanta\-pāsādika; and in detail DN\-a.i.57). It consisted in the appearance of phenomena of opposite character in pairs, as e.g. streaming forth of fire water. (Cp.; *Mvu translation* 120). The miracle was repeatedly performed by the Buddha & is often referred to, e.g. at Pts.i.125 (˚hīra); Ja.i.77, Ja.i.88, Ja.i.193; Mil.106 (˚hīraṃ), Mil.349 (˚hāriyaṃ); Mhvs.17, Mhvs.44, Mhvs.50; Mhvs.30, Mhvs.82; Mhvs.31 Mhvs.99; Dāvs i.50 (˚hīraṃ); Dhp\-a.iii.213 (id.); Snp\-a.36 Vism.390; Pv\-a.137. *\-[sālā](sālā.md)* the pair of Sal willows in between of which the Buddha passed away Vv\-a.165; Pv\-a.212.
2. (adj. or m.) a twin, twin child Mhvs.6 Mhvs.9 (yamake duve puttaṃ ca dhītaraṃ janesi), Mhvs.37 (soḷasakkhattuṃ yamake duve duve putte janayi); Dhp\-a.i.353 (same, with vijāyi).
3. (nt.) a pair, couple. Name of one of the Abhidhamma canonical books, also called Yamaka\-ppakaraṇa; Tikp.8  
   ■ The *Yamakasutta* refers to the conversion of the bhikkhu Yamaka and is given at SN.iii.109 sq.; mentioned at Vism.479 & Vb\-a.32. The phrase; *yamakato sammasana* at Vism.626 may mean “in pairs” (like kalāpato “in a bundle” ibid.), or may refer to the Yamaka\-sutta with its discussion of anicca, dukkha, anatta.
