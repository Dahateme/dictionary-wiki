\*prthag\-jana, thus puthu 1 \+ jana, but from the point of Pali identical in form and meaning with puthu 2, as shown by use of puthu in similar compounds and by C. explains. One may even say that puthu 1 = pṛthak is not felt at all in the P. word. Trenckner (*Notes* 76 already hinted at this by saying “puthujjana, partly confounded with puthu”; a connection which also underlies its expln as “one\-of\-the\-many\-folk” at *Kvu translation* 807 & 2913. It is felt to belong to puthu 2 in the same sense as Ger. “die *breite* Masse,” or Gr. οἱ πολλοί. The expln at Mnd.308 = Mnd.328 is puthu\-nānā\-janā. A long and detailed etym  
■ speculation expln of the term is found at DN\-a.i.59, trsld at *Dhs translation* 258. The BSk. form is pṛthagjana Divy.133 etc.
