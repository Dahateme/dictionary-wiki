1. 1. a deed, action, performance, esp. an act imposed or inflicted upon somebody by a higher authority (by the king as representative of justice or by kamma MN.iii.181; see *[kamma](kamma.md)* 11 3.A b.) as an ordeal, a feat or punishment: a labour or task in the sense of the 12 labours of Heracles or the labours of Hades. *kāraṇaṃ kārāpeti* “he makes somebody perform the task. Pass, kāraṇaṃ or kāraṇā karīyati. Thus as a set of *five* tasks or purgatory obligations under the name of pañcavidha\-bandhana “the group of five” (not, as Warren *trsl.* p. 257 “inflict on him the torture called the fivefold pinion”), a means of punishment in Niraya (q.v. under pañca). Not primarily torture (Rh. Davids, *Mil trsl.* i.254, and others with wrong derivation from kṛṇtati). At Dhp\-a.iii.70 these punishments are comprehended under the term dasa\-dukkhakāraṇāni (the *ten* punishments in misery); the meaning “punishment” also at Ja.iv.87 (tantarajjukaṃ k˚ṃ katvā), whereas at Ja.vi.416 k. is directly paraphrased by “maraṇa,” as much as “killing.” Often spelt karaṇa q.v.; the spelling *[kāraṇā](kāraṇā.md)* (as f.) at Mil.185 seems to be a later spelling for kāraṇaṃ. See karaṇa for further reference
