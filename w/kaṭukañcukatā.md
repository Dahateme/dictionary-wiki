closeness, tightness close\-fistedness, niggardliness. Explained as “the shrinking up of the heart,” which prevents the flow or manifestation of generosity. It occurs only in the stock phrase “vevicchaṃ kadariyaṃ k. aggahitattaṃ cittassa” in *[macchariya](macchariya.md)* \-passage at Cnd.614 = Dhs.1122 = Pp.19, Pp.23 = Vb.357, Vb.371; and in the macchariya expln at Vism.470.

der. by Bdhgh. as kaṭuka \+ añcuka *(añc)*, a popular etymology (Dhs\-a.376). At Dhs.1122 and as variant reading K in Vb we have the spelling *kaṭakancukatā* (for kaṭakuñcakatā?), on which and ˚kuñcaka see Morris, *J.P.T.S.* 1887, 159 sq. and *Dhs. trsl.* 300 n2\-Morris’ derivation is kaṭa (*kar*) \+ kañcuka \+ tā (kañcuka = kuñcaka to *kuñc*, to contract), thus a dern fr. kañcuka “bodice” and meaning “being tightened in by a bodice,” i.e. tightness. Although the reading kaṭukañc˚ is the established reading, the variant reading *kaṭakuñc˚*; is probably etym. correct, semantically undoubtedly better. It has undergone dissimilatory vowel\-metathesis under influence of popular analogy with kaṭuka. With kuñcikatā cp. the similar expression derived from the same root: *kuṇalī\-mukha*, of a stingy person Pv.ii.9#28, which is explained by “sankucitaṃ mukhaṃ akāsi” (see *[kuñcita](kuñcita.md)*)
