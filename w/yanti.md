# yanti

``` toml

see_also = ["yā", "yāti"]
```

is 3rd pl. pres. of *[yā](yā.md)*: see *[yāti](yāti.md)*  
■ *Note.* At DN.ii.269 we should combine yanti with preceding *visamā sambādhā*, thus forming denom. verbs: *visamāyanti* “become uneven” and *sambādhāyanti* “become oppressed or tight.” The translation *Dial* ii.305 gives just the opposite by reading incorrectly.
