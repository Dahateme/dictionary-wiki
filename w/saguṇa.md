adjective either “with the string,” or “in one”; Vin.i.46 (saguṇaṃ karoti to put together, to fold up; C ekato katvā). This interpretation (as “put together”) is much to be preferred to the one given under guṇa1 1; *saguṇaṃ katvā* belongs to *saṅghāṭiyo*, and not to *kāyabandhanaṃ*, thus: “the upper robes are to be given, putting them into one (bundle).”

either sa3 \+ guṇa1 1, as given under guṇa1; or sa˚ = saṃ˚ once, as in sakṛt, \+ guṇa1 2
