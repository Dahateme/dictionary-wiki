grown, become; born, produced; nature as the result of becoming. The (exegetical) definition by Bdhgh of the word *[bhūta](bhūta.md)* is interesting. He (at MN\-a.i.31) distinguishes the foll. 7 meanings of the term:

1. animate Nature as principle or the vital aggregates (the 5 Khandhas), with ref. MN.i.260;
2. ghosts (amanussā) Snp.222;
3. inanimate Nature as principle, or the Elements (the 4 dhātus SN.iii.101 (mahābhūtā);
4. all that exists, physical existence in general (vijjamānaṃ) Vin.iv.25 (bhūtaṃ)
5. what we should call a simple *predicative* use, is exemplified by a typical dogmatic example, viz. “kālaghaso *bhūto*,” where bhūta is given as meaning *khīṇāsava* (Arahant) Ja.ii.260;
6. all beings or specified existence, animal kingdom (sattā) DN.ii.157;
7. the vegetable kingdom, plants, vegetation (rukkh’ ādayo Vin.iv.34 (as bhūta\-gāma)
