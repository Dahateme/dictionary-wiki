is Kern’s (problematic) proposed reading (
» Toevoegselen

 s. v.) for *rājakhāda* at Snp.831 (rājakhādāya phuṭṭho), which is however unjustified as the original reading is well\-attested and explained in the Niddesa as such. The term as proposed would not occur by itself either (like rajakkha, only\-˚)

abstr. fr. rajakkha
