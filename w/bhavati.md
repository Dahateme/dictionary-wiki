### I. *Forms* ###

There are two bases used side by side, viz *bhav˚*; and (contracted) *ho˚*; the latter especially in the (later) Gāthā style and poetry in general, also as archaic in prose, whereas bhav˚ forms are older. On compounds with prepositions, as regards inflection, see Geiger, *P.Gr.* §§ 1312, 1513; and cp. anubhavati, abhibhavati abhisaṃ˚, pa˚ (see [pahoti](pahoti.md) and [pahūta](pahūta.md)), pari˚ vi˚, saṃ˚.

*Note.* In compound with nouns or adjectives the final vowel of these is changed into ī, as in combination of the same with the root *kṛ*; e.g. bhasmībhavati to be reduced to ashes, cp. bhasmī\-karaṇa s. v. bhasma, etc.

### II. *Meanings.* ###

In general the meaning “to become, to get” prevails, but many shades of it are possible according to context & combinations. It is impossible & unnecessary to enumerate all shades of meaning, only a few idiomatic uses may be pointed out.

1. to happen, to occur, to befall Ja.vi.368.
2. The fut *bhavissati* “is certainly,” “must be” Dhp\-a.iii.171 (sātthikā desanā bh.); Mil.40 (mātā ti pi na bh.).
3. Imper. *hotu* as adv. “very well” Mil.18 (hotu bhante very well, sir).
4. aor. in meaning and as substitute of āsiṃ, pret. of *as* to be; etad ahosi this occurred to him Dhp\-a.i.399 (assā etad ahosi “this thought struck her”).

*[bhū](bhū.md)* to become, cp. Sk. bhūmi earth; Gr. φύσις nature (physical), φύομαι to grow; Lat. fui I have been futurus = future; Oir. buith to be; Ags. būan = Goth bauan to live, Ger. bauen, also Ags. bȳldan = to build Lith. búti to be, būtas house Dhtp.1: bhū sattāyaṃ.
