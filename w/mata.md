Mata1

thought, understood, considered (as = \-˚), only late in use Vb.2 (hīna˚ paṇīta˚, doubtful reading); Sdhp.55; Mhvs.25, Mhvs.55 (tassā matena according to her opinion); Mhvs.25, Mhvs.110 (pasu\-samā matā, pl. considered like beasts). Cp. sam˚  
■ *Note.* Does *mata\-sāyika* at Thag.501 (= Mil.367) belong under this mata? Then mata would have to be taken as nt. meaning “thought thinking,” but the phrase is not without objection both semantically & syntactically. Mrs. Rh. D (*Brethren*, p. 240) trsls “nesting\-place of thought.”
