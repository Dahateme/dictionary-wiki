= parideva MN.i.56 (soka˚); AN.i.221; Thig.345 (soka˚); Snp.1052, cp. Cnd.416 (see *[parideva](parideva.md)*).

according to Trenckner MN.i.532 (on MN.i.56, where SS read p., whereas BB have parideva) the metrical substitute for parideva; therefore not = Sk paridrava, which is only a late re\-translation of the P word
