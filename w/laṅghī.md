Laṅghi (Laṅghī)

feminine

1. a kind of deer (?) Ja.vi.537.
2. doubtful of meaning & origin in phrase; *laṅghī\-pitāmahā* at Ja.ii.363 = Ja.iii.226: “whose grandfather was a deer, or a jumper” (?); used in disparagingly addressing a crane. The C. to Ja.ii.363 explains rather strangely as follows: *laṅghī vuccati ākāse* langhanato megho “(a) jumping deer is called the cloud because of its jumping in the air,” *balākā ca nāma megha\-saddena gabbhaṃ gaṇhantī ti* “the cranes conceive by the sound of the cloud,” *meghasaddo balākānaṃ pitā megho pitāmaho ti* “the sound of the cloud is the father of the cranes & the cloud the grandfather”

fr. *laṅgh*
