    s. v. vikāra is hardly correct in translating *hattha\-vikārena* at Vin.i.157 by “eigenhandig,” i.e. with his own hand. It has to be combined with hattha\-vilanghakena.
3. perturbation disturbance, inconvenience, deformity Vin.i.271, Vin.i.272 (˚ṃ sallakkheti observe the uneasiness); Mil.224 (tāvataka v. temporary inconvenience), Mil.254 (˚vipphāra disturbing influence); Snp\-a.189 (bhūta˚ natural blemish)
4. constitution, property, quality (cp. *Cpd.* 1572 1681) Vism.449 (rūpa˚ material quality); Vv\-a.10 (so correct under *[maya](maya.md)* in *P.D.* vol. iii. p. 147).
5. deception, fraud Pv\-a.211 (= nikati)
