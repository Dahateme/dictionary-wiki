\-R\-

the letter (or sound) *r*, used as euphonic consonant to avoid hiatus. The sandhi\-r\-originates from the final r of nouns in ˚ir & ˚ur of the Vedic period. In Pali it is felt as euphonic consonant only, like other sandhi consonants (y for instance) which in the older language were part of the noun itself. Thus r even where it is legitimate in a word may interchange with other sandhi\-consonants in the same word, as we find punam\-eva and puna\-d\-eva besides the original puna\-r\-eva (= Vedic punar eva). At Ja.i.403 we read “punar āgata,” where the C. explains “puna āgata, ra\-kāro sandhivasena vutto.” Similarly: Snp.81 (vutti\-r\-esā), Snp.214 (thambho\-r  
■ iva), Snp.625 = Dhp.401 (āragge\-r\-iva), Dhp.679 (ati\-r\-iva), Dhp.687 (sarada\-r\-iva), Dhp.1134 (haṃsa\-r\-iva) Vv.64#22 (Vajir’ āvudho\-r\-iva); Pv.ii.8#7 (puna\-r\-eva Pv.ii.11#6 (id.); Pv\-a.77 (su\-r\-abhigandha). In the latter cause the r has no historical origin, as little as in the phrase *dhir atthu* (for \*dhig\-atthu) Snp.440; Ja.i.59. Ramsi & Rasmi;
