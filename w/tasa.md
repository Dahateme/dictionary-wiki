adjective

1. trembling, frightened Ja.i.336 = Ja.i.344 (vakā, expl. at Ja.i.342 by tasita); perhaps the derived meaning of:
2. moving, running (cp. to meaning 1 & 2 Gr.; τρέω to flee & to tremble), always in combn *tasa\-thāvarā* (pl.) movable & immovable beings [cp. Mvu.i.207 jangama\-sthāvara; ii.10 calaṃ sthāvara]. Metaphorically of people who are in fear & trembling, as distinguished from a thāvara, a selfpossessed & firm being (= Arahant Kp\-a.245). In this sense t. is interpreted by tasati1 as well as by tasati2 (to have thirst or worldly cravings) at Kp\-a.245 tasantī ti tasā, sataṇhānaṃ sabhayānañ c’ etaṃ adhivacanaṃ; also at Cnd.479: tasa ti yesaṃ tasitā (tasiṇā? taṇhā appahīnā, etc., & ye te santāsaṃ āpajjanti.; SN.i.141; SN.iv.117, SN.iv.351; SN.v.393; Snp.146, Snp.629; Dhp.405 Thag.876; Ja.v.221; Cnd.479; Dhp\-a.iv.175.
