(& *Dhūta*)

1. shaken, moved Dāvs v.49 (vāta˚).
2. lit. “shaken off,” but always explained in the commentaries as “one who shakes off” either cvil dispositions (kilese), or obstacles to spiritual progress (vāra, nīvaraṇa). The word is rare. In one constantly repeated passage (Vin.i.45 = Vin.i.305 = Vin.ii.2 = Vin.iii.21 = Vin.iv.213) it is an adjective opposed to *[kosajja](kosajja.md)* lazy, remiss; and means either scrupulous or punctilious. At DN.i.5 it is used of a pain. At Snp.385 we are told of a *dhutadhamma*, meaning a scrupulous way of life, first for a bhikkhu, then for a layman. This poem omits all higher doctrine and confines itself to scrupulousness as regards minor elementary matters. Cp. Vism.61 for a defn of dhuta.

* *\-[aṅga](aṅga.md)* a set of practices leading to the state of or appropriate to a dhuta, that is to a scrupulous person. First occurs in a title suffixed to a passage in the Parivāra deprecating such practices. The passage occurs twice (Vin.v.131, Vin.v.193), but the title, probably later than the text, is added only to the second of the two. The passage gives a list of 13 such practices, each of them an ascetic practice not enjoined in the Vinaya. The 13 are also discussed at Vism.59 sq. The Milinda devotes a whole book (chap. vi.) to the glorification of these 13 dhutangas, but there is no evidence that they were ever widely adopted. Some are deprecated at MN.i.282, & examples of one or other of them are given at Vin.iii.15; Bv.i.59; Ja.iii.342; Ja.iv.8; Mil.133, Mil.348 Mil.351; Vism.59 (˚kathā), Vism.65 (˚cora), Vism.72 (id.), Vism.80 (defn) Snp\-a.494; Dhp\-a.i.68; Dhp\-a.ii.32 (dhūtanga); Dhp\-a.iv.30. Mnd.188 says that 8 of them are desirable.
* *\-[dhara](dhara.md)* mindful of punctiliousness Mil.342 (āraññaka dh. jhāyin).
* *\-[vata](vata.md)* the vow to perform the dhutangas Dhp\-a.vi.165.
* *\-[vāda](vāda.md)* one who inculcates punctiliousness SN.ii.156; AN.i.23; Mil.380; Vism.80; Thag\-a.69; Dhp\-a.ii.30.
* *\-[vādin](vādin.md)* ˚vāda Ja.i.130.
