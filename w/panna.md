fallen, gone, gone down; also: creeping only in foll. compounds:

* *\-ga* a snake Thag.429 (˚inda chief of snake\-demons) Ja.v.166; Mil.23.
* *\-[gandha](gandha.md)* with gone down (i.e. deteriorated) smell, ill\-smelling, or having lost its smell Ja.v.198 (= thokaṃ duggandha C.).
* *\-[dhaja](dhaja.md)* one whose flag gone or is lost, i.e. whose fight is over (Ep of the Buddha), cp. BSk. prapātito māna\-dhvajaḥ Lal.448 (with derivation from *pat* instead of *pad* cp. papātana) MN.i.139 sq., MN.i.386; AN.iii.84 sq.; in eulogy on the Buddha (see exegesis to mahesi Mnd.343; Cnd.503) reference is made to mānadhaja (˚papātanaṃ which is opposed to dhamma\-dhaja (\-ussapana); thus we should explain as “one who has put down the flag of pride.”
* *\-[bhāra](bhāra.md)* one who has put down his burden, one whose load has gone, who is delivered or saved MN.i.139; AN.iii.84; SN.i.233; Dhp.402 (= ohitakhandha\-bhāra Dhp\-a.iv.168); Snp.626, Snp.914 (cp Mnd.334) Thag.1021.
* *\-[bhūmi](bhūmi.md)* state of one who has fallen DN\-a.i.103 (opp. to jina\-bhūmi, one of the 8 purisa\-bhūmiyo\-cp. DN.i.54 & *Dial.* i.722).
* *\-[loma](loma.md)* one whose hairs have fallen or are put down (flat, i.e. do not stand erect in consequence of excitement), subdued, pacified (opp. haṭṭha loma) Vin.ii.184 (cp. Vin.ii.5 & Bdhgh on p. 309 lomaṃ pāteti, Bdhgh pādeti; also *Vin. Texts* ii.339); iii.266; MN.i.450; Ja.i.377. Another form is *[palloma](palloma.md)* (q.v. & cp.; *J.P.T.S.* 1889, 206). See also remarks on parada\-vutta.

pp. of pajjati but not satisfactorily explained as such, for pajjati & panna never occur by themselves, but only in compounds like āpajjati, āpanna, upp˚, upa˚, sam˚ etc. Besides, the word is only given in lexic. literature as pp. of pajjati, although a tendency prevails to regard it as pp. of patati. The meaning points more to the latter, but in form it cannot belong to; *pat*. A more satisfactory expln (in meaning and form) is to regard panna as pp. of pa \+ *nam*, with der. fr. short base. Thus *[panna](panna.md)* would stand for panata (paṇata) as unna for unnata, ninna for ninnata, the double nn to be accounted for on analogy. The meaning would thus be “bent down, laid down,” as panna\-ga going bent, panna\-dhaja = flag bent or laid down etc. Perhaps patta of patta\-kkhandha should belong here as panna˚
