to get to, be reborn in (acc.) to originate, rise Vin.iii.20 (nirayaṃ); AN.iii.415; AN.v.292 sq.; Snp.584; Iti.13 (nirayaṃ), Iti.14 (sugatiṃ; variant reading upp˚), Iti.67 (saggaṃ lokaṃ; variant reading upp˚); Iti.43 = Dhp.307 (nirayaṃ); Dhp.126, Dhp.140; Pv.i.10#7 (variant reading BB. udapajjatha = uppajja Pv\-a.50); Pp.16, Pp.51, Pp.60; Ne.37, Ne.99, cp. Kv.611 sq. pp. *upapannā* (q.v.)

doubtful whether a legitimate form as upa \+ *pad* or a diaeretic form of uppajjati = ud \+ *pad*. In this case all passages ought to go under the latter. Trenckner however (*Notes* 77) defends upa˚ & considers in many cases upp˚ a substitution for upa. The diaeresis may be due to metre, as nearly all forms are found in poetry. The variant reading upp˚ is apparently frequent; but it is almost impossible to distinguish between upap˚ and upp˚ in the Sinhalese writing, and either the scribe or the reader may mistake one for the other
