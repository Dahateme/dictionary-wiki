Kāla & Kāḷa

### Preliminary ###

1. dark (syn. kaṇha, which cp. for meaning and applications), black, blueblack, misty, cloudy. Its proper sphere of application is the dark as opposed to light, and it is therefore characteristic of all phenomena or beings belonging to the realm of darkness, as the night, the new moon, death ghosts, etc.  
   There are two etymologies suggestible both of which may have been blended since Indo\-Aryan times:
   1. kāla = Sk. kāla, blue\-black, kālī black cloud from *\*qāl* (with which conn. *\*qel* in kalanka spot, kalusa dirty, kammāsa speckled, Gr. κελαινός, Mhg. hilwe mist) = Lat. cālidus spot, Gr. κηλίς spot and κηλάς dark cloud; cp. Lat. cālīgo mist, fog, darkness\-
   2. see below, under note  
      ■ Hence:

2. the morning mist, or darkness preceding light, daybreak, morning (cp. E. morning = Goth. maúrgins twilight Sk. marka eclipse, darkness; and also gloaming gleaming = twilight), then: time in general, esp. a fixed time, a point from or to which to reckon, i.e. term or terminus (a quo or ad quem)

■ *Note.* The definition of colour\-expressions is extremely difficult. To a primitive colour\-sense the principal difference worthy of notation is that between dark and light, or dull and bright, which in their expressions, however, are represented as complements for which the same word may be used in either sense of the complementary part (dark for light and vice versa, cp. E. gleam → gloom). All we can say is that kāla belongs to the group of expressions for *dark* which may be represented simultaneously by black, blue, or brown. That on the other hand, black when polished or smooth, supplies also the notion of “shining” is evidenced by kāḷa and kaṇha as well as e.g. by *\*skei* in Sk. chāyā = Gr. σκιά shadow as against Ags. hāēven “blue” (E. heaven) and Ohg skīnan, E. to shine and sky. The psychological value of a colour depends on its light\-reflecting (or light\-absorbing) quality. A bright black appears lighter (reflects more light) than a dull grey, therefore a polished (añjana) black (= sukāḷa) may readily be called “brilliant.” In the same way *[kāla](kāla.md)*, combined with other colour\-words of *black* connotation does not need to mean “black,” but may mean simply a kind of black i.e. brown. This depends on the semasiological contrast or equation of the passage in question. Cp. Sk śyāma (dark\-grey) and śyāva (brown) under kāsāya. That the notion of the speckled or variegated colour belongs to the sphere of black, is psychologically simple (dark specks against a light ground, cp. kammāsa), and is also shown by the *second etymology of kāla* = Sk śāra, mottled, speckled = Lat. caerulus, black\-blue and perhaps caelum “the blue” (cp. heaven) = Gr. κηρύλος the blue ice\-bird. (On k → s cp. kaṇṇa → śṛṇga, kilamati → śramati, kilissati → *ślis˚*; etc.) The usual spelling of kāla as kāḷa indicates a connection of the ḷ with the r of śāra

■ The definition of kāḷa as jhām’ angārasadisa is conventional and is used both by Bdhgh. and Dhpāla: Dhs\-a.317 and Pv\-a.90–Pv\-a.91

1. *Kāḷa*, dark, black, etc., in enumn of colours Vv.22#1 (see Vv\-a.111). na kāḷo samaṇo Gotamo, na pi sāmo: mangura\-cchavi samano G. “The ascetic Gotamo is neither black nor brown: he is of a golden skin” MN.i.246; similarly as kāḷī vā sāmā vā manguracchavī vā of a kalyāṇī, a beautiful woman at DN I.193 MN.ii.40; kāḷa\-sāma at Vin.iv.120 is to be taken as dark\-grey  
   ■ Of the dark half of the month: see ˚*[pakkha](pakkha.md)*, or as the new moon: āgame kāḷe “on the next new moon day” Vin.i.176  
   ■ of Petas: Pv.ii.4#1 (kāḷī f.); Pv\-a.56#2 (˚rūpa); of the dog of Yama (˚sunakha Pv\-a.151  
   ■ In other connn: kāḷavaṇṇa\-bhūmi dark\-brown (i.e. fertile) soil Vin.i.48 = Vin.ii.209.  
   ■ *\-[añjana](añjana.md)* black collyrium Vin.i.203; *\-ānusārī* black (polished?) Anusāri (“a kind of dark, fragrant sandal wood” *Vin. Texts* ii.51) Vin.i.203; SN.iii.156 = SN.v.44; AN.v.22; *\-[ayasa](ayasa.md)* black (dark) iron (to distinguish it from bronze, Rh. D., *Mil trsl.* ii.364; cp. blacksmith → silversmith) Mil.414, Mil.415; *\-[kañjaka](kañjaka.md)* a kind of Asuras Titans DN.iii.7; Ja.v.187; Pv\-a.272; *\-kaṇṇī* “black\-eared”, as an unlucky quality. Cp.iii.6#11; Ja.i.239; Ja.iv.189 Ja.v.134, Ja.v.211; Ja.vi.347; Dhp\-a.i.307; Dhp\-a.ii.26; the vision of the “black\-eared” is a bad omen, which spoils the luck of a hunter, e.g. at Dhp\-a.iii.31 (referring here to the sight of a bhikkhu); as “witch” Pv\-a.272; Dhp\-a.iii.38, Dhp\-a.iii.181 as k\-k. sakuṇa, a bird of ill omen Ja.ii.153; *\-kaṇṇika* prec.; *\-[kabara](kabara.md)* spotted, freckled Ja.vi.540; *\-[kesa](kesa.md)* (adj. with glossy or shiny hair, by itself (kāḷa\-kesa) rare e.g. at Ja.vi.578; usually in cpd. *susukāḷa\-kesa* “having an over\-abundance of brilliant hair” said of Gotama. This was afterwards applied figuratively in the description of his parting from home, rising to a new life, as it were, possessed of the full strength and vigour of his manhood (as the rising Sun). Cp. the Shamash\-Saga which attributes to the Sun a wealth of shiny, glossy (= polished, dark) hair (= rays), and kāḷa in this connection is to be interpreted just as kaṇha (q.v.) in similar combinations (e.g. as Kṛṣṇa Hṛṣīkesa or Kesavā) On this feature of the Sun\-god and various expressions of it see ample material in Palmer, *The Samson Saga* pp. 33–⁠46  
   ■ The double application of su˚ does not offer any difficulty, sukāḷa is felt as a simplex in the same way as εὐπλοκαμός or duh˚ in combinations like sudubbala Pv\-a.149, sudullabha Vv\-a.20. Bdhgh. already interprets the cpd. in this way (DN\-a.i.284 = suṭṭhu\-k˚ *añjana\-vaṇṇa* k˚ va hutvā; cp. kaṇh\-añjana Ja.v.155) Cp. also siniddha\-nīla\-mudu\-kuñcita\-keso Ja.i.89, and sukaṇhakaṇha Ja.v.202  
   ■ susukāḷakesa of others than the Buddha: MN.ii.66. Modern editors and lexicographers see in susu˚ the Sk. śiśu young of an animal, cub, overlooking the semantical difficulty involved by taking it as a separate word. This mistake has been applied to the compound at all the passages where it is found, and so we find the reading susu kāḷakeso at MN.i.82 = AN.ii.22 = Ja.ii.57; MN.i.163 = AN.i.68 = SN.i.9, SN.i.117; also in *Childers’* (relying on Burnouf), or even susū k˚ at SN.iv.111; the only passages showing the right reading susu\-k˚ are DN.i.115, MN.i.463. Konow under susu *J.P.T.S.* 1909 212 has both. *\-[kokila](kokila.md)* the black (brown) cuckoo Vv\-a.57; *\-jallika* (kāḷi˚ for kāḷa˚) having black drops or specks (of dirt) AN.i.253; *\-[daṇḍa](daṇḍa.md)* a black staff, Sdhp.287 (attr. to the messengers of Yama, cp. Yama as having a black stick at Śat. Br. xi. 6, 1, 7 and 13); *\-[pakkha](pakkha.md)* the dark side, i.e. moonless fortnight of the month AN.ii.18\-˚ *cātuddasī* the 14th day of the dark fortnight Pv\-a.55\-˚ *ratti* a moonless night Vv\-a.167; (opp. dosina r. *\-meyya* a sort of bird Ja.vi.539; *\-[loṇa](loṇa.md)* black (dark) salt Vin.i.202 (Bdhgh. pakati\-loṇa, natural salt); *\-[loha](loha.md)* “black metal,” iron ore Mil.267; *\-[valli](valli.md)* a kind of creeper Vism.36, Vism.183. *\-[sīha](sīha.md)* a special kind of lion Ja.iv.208. *\-[sutta](sutta.md)* a black thread or wire, a carpenter’s measuring line Ja.ii.405; Mil.413; also Name of a Purgatory (niraya) Ja.v.266.

Cp. vikāla. (3) The day as appointed by fate or kamma, point of time (for death, cp. Vism.236), the “last hour,” cp. ἠμαρ, illa dies.
