(see Kvu trsl. 234 n. 2 and Cpd. 172 n. 2). Bent, bias proclivity, the persistance of a dormant or latent disposition predisposition, tendency. Always in bad sense. In the oldest texts the word usually occurs absolutely, without mention of the cause or direction of the bias. So Sn.14 = 369, 545; MN.iii.31; SN.iii.130, SN.iv.33, SN.v.28 SN.v.236; AN.i.44; AN.ii.157; AN.iii.74, AN.iii.246, AN.iii.443. Or in the triplet obstinacy, prejudice and bias (*adhiṭṭhānābhinivesānusayā*) SN.ii.17; SN.iii.10, SN.iii.135, SN.iii.161; AN v.iii. Occasionally a source of the bias is mentioned. Thus pride at SN.i.188 SN.ii.252 ff., SN.ii.275; SN.iii.80, SN.iii.103, SN.iii.169, SN.iii.253; SN.iv.41, SN.iv.197; AN.i.132 AN.iv.70 doubt at MN.i.486\-ignorance lust and hatred at SN.iv.205, MN.iii.285. At DN.iii.254, DN.iii.282; SN.v.60; and AN.iv.9. we have a list of seven anusaya’s, the above five and delusion and craving for rebirth. Hence\-forward these lists govern the connotation of the word; but it would be wrong to put that connotation back into the earlier passages. Later references are Pts.i.26, Pts.i.70 ff., Pts.i.123 Pts.i.130, Pts.i.195; Pts.ii.36, Pts.ii.84, Pts.ii.94, Pts.ii.158; Pp.21; Vb.340, Vb.383 Vb.356; Kv.405 ff. Dpvs.i.42.
