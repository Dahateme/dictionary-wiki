to throw, to cast, to throw out or forth, to upset Snp.p.32 (cittaṃ); Ja.i.223 (sīsaṃ), Ja.i.290 (pāsake); Ja.ii.3 (daḷhaṃ dalhassa: to pit force against force)  
aor khipi SN.iv.2, SN.iv.3 (khuracakkaṃ); Pv\-a.87 (= atthāresi)  
ger khipitvā Ja.i.202  
caus 1 khepeti (perhaps to *kṣi*, see *[khaya](khaya.md)*) to throw in, to put in, to spend (of time): dīgham addhānaṃ khepetvā Ja.i.137; Thig.168 (khepeti jātisaṃsāraṃ = pariyosāpeti Thag\-a.159); Dhp\-a.i.102 (dvenavuti\-kappe khepesuṃ) āyuṃ khepehi spend (the rest of) your life Pv\-a.148 ger. *khepayitvāna* (saṃsāraṃ) Pv.iv.3#32 (= khepetvā Pv\-a.254). In this sense Trenckner (P. M. 76) takes it as corresponding to Sk. kṣāpayati of *kṣi* = to cause to waste. See also khepana.  
caus 2 khipāpeti to cause to be thrown Ja.i.202; Ja.iv.139 (jalaṃ). Cp also khepa.
