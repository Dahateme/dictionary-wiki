in “kārāpesi *tilañcanaṃ*” at Dpvs.20, 10 is not clear. We may have to correct reading into *lañchanaṃ* or *lañchakaṃ*. Oldenberg in his translation (p. 211) leaves the word out and remarks: “Probably this passage refers to the three *pupphayāna* mentioned in the Mahāvaṃsa (33, 22, where Geiger reads “pupphādhānāni tīṇi, with translation “3 stone terraces for offerings of flowers”) though I do not know how to explain or to correct the word used here *(tilañcanaṃ).*”
