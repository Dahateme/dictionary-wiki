■ *[vitakka](vitakka.md)* is often combined with *[vicāra](vicāra.md)* or “initial & sustained application Mrs. Rh. D.; *Cpd.* 282; “reflection & investigation Rh. D.; to denote the whole of the mental process of thinking (viz. fixing one’s attention and reasoning out or as *Cpd.* 17 explains it “*[vitakka](vitakka.md)* is the directing of concomitant properties towards the object; *[vicāra](vicāra.md)* is the continued exercise of the mind on that object.” See also above defn at Vism.142). Both are properties of the *first* *[jhāna](jhāna.md)* (called sa\-vitakka sa\-vicāra) but are discarded in the *second* *[jhāna](jhāna.md)* (called a˚). See e.g. DN.i.37; SN.iv.360 sq.; AN.iv.300; Vin.iii.4; Vism.85 and formula of jhāna. The same of pīti & samādhi at Vb.228, of; *[paññā](paññā.md)* at Vb.323. The same combination (vitakka \+ vicāra) at foll. passages: DN.iii.219 (of samādhi which is either sa˚, or a˚, or avitakka vicāra\-matta) SN.iv.193; SN.v.111; AN.iv.409 sq., AN.iv.450; Ne.16; Mil.60 Mil.62; Vism.453. Cp. *rūpa\-* (sadda\-etc.) vitakka \+ rūpa (sadda\-etc.) vicāra AN.iv.147; AN.v.360; Vb.103  
■ On term (also with *[vicāra](vicāra.md)*) see further: *Cpd.* 40, 56, 98 238 sq., 282 (on difference between v. & manasikāra) *Expos.* i.188n; *Kvu translation* 2381  
■ Cp. pa˚, pari˚.

*Note.* Looking at the combination *vitakka \+ vicāra* in earlier and later works one comes to the conclusion that they were once used to denote one & the same thing: just thought, thinking, only in an emphatic way (as they are also semantically synonymous), and that one has to take them as; *one* expression, like *jānāti passati*, without being able to state their difference. With the advance in the Sangha of intensive study of terminology they became distinguished mutually. Vitakka became the inception of mind, or attending, and was no longer applied, as in the Suttas, to thinking in general. The explains of Commentators are mostly of an edifying nature and based more on popular etymology than on natural psychological grounds.
