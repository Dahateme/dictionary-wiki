to desire.

1. *Objective*: pleasantness, pleasure\-giving, an object of sensual enjoyment.
2. *Subjective*: (a) enjoyment, pleasure on occasion of sense, (b) sense\-desire.

Buddhist commentators express 1 and 2 by kāmiyatī ti kāmo, and kametī ti kāmo *Cpd.* 81, n.2. Kāma as sense\-desire and enjoyment *plus* objects of the same is a collective name for all but the very higher or refined conditions of life. The kāma\-bhava or\-loka (worlds of sensedesire) includes 4 of the 5 modes (gatis) of existence and part of the fifth or deva\-loka. See Bhava. The term is not found analyzed till the later books of the Canon are consulted, thus, Mnd.1 distinguishes:

1. *vatthukāmā*: desires relating to a base, i.e. physical organ or external object, and
2. *kilesakāmā*: desire considered subjectively.

So also Cnd.202, quoted Dhp\-a.ii.162; Dhp\-a.iii.240; and very often as ubho kāmā. A more logical definition is given by Dhammapāla on Vv.1#1 (Vv\-a.11). He classifies kāma as concerned with:

1. *manāpiyā rūpādi\-visayā*: pleasant objects
2. *chandarāga*: impulsive desire
3. *sabbasmiṃ lobha*: greed for anything
4. *gāmadhamma*: sexual lust
5. *hitacchanda*: effort to do good
6. *serībhāva* : self\-determination.

In all enumerations of obstacles to perfection, or of general divisions and definitions of mental conditions kāma occupies the leading position. It is the first of the five obstacles (nīvaraṇāni), the three esanās (longings), the four upādānas (attachments), the four oghas (floods of worldly turbulence), the four āsavas (intoxicants of mind), the three taṇhās, the four yogas; and k stands first on the list of the six factors of existence kāmā, vedanā, saññā, āsavā, kamma, dukkha, which are discussed at AN.iii.410 sq. as regards their origin difference, consequences, destruction and remedy. Kāma is most frequently connected with rāga (passion) with chanda (impulse) and gedha (greed), all expressing the active, clinging, and impulsive character of desire. The foll. is the list of synonyms given at various places for kāma\-cchanda:

1. *chanda*, impulse;
2. *rāga* excitement;
3. *nandī*, enjoyment;
4. *taṇhā*, thirst
5. *sineha*, love;
6. *pipāsā*, thirst;
7. *pariḷāha*, consuming passion;
8. *gedha*, greed;
9. *mucchā*, swoon or confused state of mind;
10. *ajjhosāna*, hanging on, or attachment.

Nd1. At Cnd.200; Dhs.1097 (omitting No. 8), cp. Dhs\-a.370; similarly at Vism.569 (omitting Nos. 6 and 8), cp. Dhs.1214; Vb.375. This set of 10 characteristics is followed by kām\-ogha, kāma\-yoga kām\-upādāna at Cnd.200, cp. Vism.141 (kām\-ogha ˚āsava, ˚upādāna). Similarly at DN.iii.238: kāme avigata\-rāga, ˚chanda, ˚pema, ˚pipāsa, ˚pariḷāha ˚taṇha. See also kāma\-chanda below under compounds. In connection with synonyms it may be noticed that most of the verbs used in a kāma\-context are verbs the primary meaning of which is “adhering to” or “grasping,” hence, attachment; viz. esanā (*iṣ* to Lat ira) upādāna (upa \+ ā \+ *dā* taking up), taṇhā (*tṛṣ*, Lat torreo = thirst) pipāsā (the wish to drink), sineha (*snih*, Lat. nix = melting), etc.

On the other hand, the reaction of the passions on the subject is expressed by khajjati “to be eaten up” pariḍayhati “to be burnt, etc. The foll. passage also illustrates the various synonymic expressions: kāme paribhuñjati, kāmamajjhe vasati, kāma\-pariḷāhena pariḍayhati, kāmavitakkehi *[khajjati](khajjati.md)*, kāma\-pariyesanāyā ussukko, AN.i.68 cp. MN.i.463; MN.iii.129. Under this aspect kāma is essentially an evil, but to the popular view it is one of the indispensable attributes of bliss and happiness to be enjoyed as a reward of virtue in this world (mānussakāmā) as well as in the next (dibbā kāmā). See kāmāvacara about the various stages of next\-world happiness. Numerous examples are to be found in Pv and Vv where a standing epithet of the Blest is sabbakāmasamiddha “fully equipped with all objects of pleasure, e.g. Pv.i.10#5; Pv\-a.46. The other\-world pleasures are greater than the earthly ones: SN.v.409; but to the Wise even these are unsatisfactory, since they still are signs of, and lead to, rebirth (kāmûpapatti, It (4): api dibbesu kāmesu ratiṃ so nâdhigacchati Dhp.187; rāgaṃ vinayetha mānusesu dibbesu kāmesu cāpi bhikkhu Snp.361 see also Iti.94

Kāma as sensual pleasure finds its most marked application in the sphere of the sexual kāmesu micchācārin, transgressing in lusts, sinning in the lusts of the flesh, or violating the third rule of conduct equivalent to abrahmacariyā, inchastity (see *[sīla](sīla.md)* Pp.38, Pp.39; Iti.63, etc. itthi\-kāmehi paricāreti “he enjoys himself with the charms of woman” SN.iv.343 Kāmesu *brahmacariyavā* practising chastity Snp.1041 Kāmatthā for sexual amusement AN.iii.229.

Redemption from kāma is to be effected by self\-control *(saṃyama)* and meditation *(jhāna)*, by knowledge right effort and renunciation. “To give up passion” as a practice of him who wishes to enter on the Path is expressed by:

* kāmānaṃ pahānaṃ, kāmasaññānaṃ pariññā, kāma\-pipāsānaṃ\-paṭivinayo, kāmavitakkānaṃ samugghāto kāma\-pariḷāhānaṃ vūpasamo Vin.iii.111
* kāmesu (ca) *appaṭibaddhacitto* “uddhaṃsoto” ti vuccati: he whose mind is not in the bonds of desire is called “one who is above the stream” Dhp.218 cp. Thig.12

### Character of Kāmā ###

The pleasures of the senses are evanescent, transient (sabbe kāmā aniccā, etc. AN.ii.177) and of no real taste (appāsādā); they do not give permanent satisfaction; the happiness which they yield is only a deception, or a dream, from which the dreamer awakens with sorrow and regret. Therefore the Buddha says “Even though the pleasure is great, the regret is greater: ādīnavo ettha bhīyyo” (see k\-sukha). Thus kāmā as *kālikā* (needing time) SN.i.9, SN.i.117; *aniccā* (transitory) SN.i.22; kāmā citrā madhurā “pleasures are manifold and sweet” (i.e. tasty) Snp.50; but also appassādā bahudukkhā bahupāyāsā: quot. MN.i.91 see Cnd.71. Another passage with var. descriptions and comparisons of kāma, beginning with *app’ assādā* dukkhā kāmā is found at Ja.iv.118. *\-atittaṃ* yeva kāmesu antako kurute vasaṃ Dhp.48  
■ *na kahāpaṇavassena titti kāmesu vijjati appasādā dukkhā kāmā iti viññāya paṇḍito* “not for showers of coins is satisfaction to be found in pleasures\-of no taste and full of misery are pleasures: thus say the wise and they understand” Dhp.186; cp. MN.i.130; Vin.ii.25 (cp. Divy.224)  
■ *Kāmato jāyatī soko kāmato jāyatī bhayaṃ kāmato vippamuttassa n’atthi soko kuto bhayan ti* “of pleasure is born sorrow, of pleasure is born fear” Dhp.215. Kāmānam adhivacanāni, attributes of kāma are bhaya, dukkha, roga, gaṇḍa, salla, sanga, panka, gabbha AN.iv.289; Cnd.p.62 on Snp.51; same, except salla gabbha: AN.iii.310. The misery of such pleasures is painted in vivid colours in the Buddha’s discourse on pains of pleasures MN.i.85 and parallel passages (see e.g. Cnd.199), how kāma is the cause of egoism, avarice quarrels between kings, nations, families, how it leads to warfare, murder, lasciviousness, torture and madness *Kāmānaṃ ādīnavo* (the danger of passions) MN.i.85 sq = Cnd.199, quot. Snp\-a.114 (on Snp.61); as one of the five anupubbikathās: K˚ ādīnavaṃ okāraṃ saṃkilesaṃ AN.iv.186, AN.iv.209, AN.iv.439  
■ they are the leaders in the army of Māra: kāmā te paṭhamā senā Snp.436  
■ yo evamvādī… n’atthi kāmesu doso ti so kāmesu pātavyataṃ āpajjati AN.i.266 = MN.i.305 sq.
