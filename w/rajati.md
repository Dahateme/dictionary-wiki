usually intrs. *[rajjati](rajjati.md)* (q.v.). As *[rajitabba](rajitabba.md)* (grd.) in meaning “to be bleached” (dhovitabba \+) only in meaning “bleach” (as compared with *[dhovati](dhovati.md)* clean, & *[vijaṭeti](vijaṭeti.md)* to disentangle, smoothe) Vin.iii.235 (ppr. fr. pl. dhovantiyo rajantiyo etc.); Ja.i.8 (rajitabba, grd.; dhovitabba \+)  
■ Somehow it is difficult to distinguish between the meanings “bleach” and “dye” (cp rajaka), in some combinations with *[dhovati](dhovati.md)* it clearly means “dye,” as at Vin.i.50 (forms: rajati, rajitabba, rajiyetha 3 sg. Pot. Med.); Vism.65 (forms: rajitvā, rajitabba rajituṃ)  
■ Another grd. *[rajanīya](rajanīya.md)* in diff. meaning (see sep.). Caus. *rajeti* to paint, colour Thag.1155 (inf rajetave: (see Geiger, *P.Gr.* § 204, 1. a).
