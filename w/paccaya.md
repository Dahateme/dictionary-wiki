Usually with ref. to the 4 necessaries of the bhikkhu’s daily life, viz. cīvara, piṇḍapāta, senāsana (gilānapaccaya\-) bhesajja, i.e. clothing, food as alms a dwelling\-place, medicine: see under; *[cīvara](cīvara.md)*. Snp.339 (paccaya = gilāna\-paccaya Snp\-a.342); Mil.336; Mhvs.3 Mhvs.15.
2. (applied) reason, cause, ground, motive, means condition MN.i.259 (yaṃ yad eva paccayaṃ paṭicca by whatever cause or by whichever means); SN.ii.65; Ne.78 sq.; DN\-a.i.125; Pv\-a.104. The fourfold cause (catubbidho paccayo) of rūpa (material form) consists of kamma, citta, utu, āhāra: Vism.600. Var. paccayas discussed at Vb\-a.166 sq.

   ■ yathā paccayaṃ karoti do as he likes Cnd.280 = SN.iii.33. Often coupled with hetu, e.g. at SN.iv.68 sq.; AN.i.66; AN.iv.151 sq. DN.iii.284; Nd ii.under mūla; Pts.ii.116 sq., *paccaya* came to be distinguished from hetu as the genus of which *hetu* was the typical, chief species. i.e. paccaya became synonymous with our “relation,” understood in a causal sense, hetu meaning condition, causal antecedent and 23 other relations being added as special modes of causality. Later still these 24 were held reducible to 4 Tikp.1 f. (and foreword); *Cpd.* 197 Cp. Paṭṭhāna
