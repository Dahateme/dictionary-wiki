to be disgusted with, to avoid, shun, turn away from Snp.281 (T. abhinibbijjayātha, variant reading BB˚ nibbijjiyātha & ˚nibbajjiyātha, Snp\-a explains by vivajjeyyātha mā bhajeyyātha; variant reading BB. abhinippajjiyā) = AN.iv.172 (T. abhinibbajjayātha vv.ll. ˚nibbajjeyyātha & ˚nibbijjayātha); ger. *abhinibbijja* Thig.84.

either Med. fr. nibbindati of *vid* for \*nirvidyate (see *[nibbindati](nibbindati.md)* B), or secondary formation fr ger. nibbijja. Reading however not beyond all doubt
