1. (Pass.) eaten, being eaten Snp.p.15; Dhp.308; impers. eating Vin.iv.82 (bhuttaṃ hoti). Also *\-geha* eating house Ja.v.290, and in phrase *yathā\-bhuttaṃ bhuñjatha* “eat according to eating,” i.e. as ought to be eaten, eating in moderation DN.ii.173 (where Rh. D., *Dial.* ii.203, trsls “ye shall eat as ye have eaten”) = DN.iii.62, DN.iii.63 (where Rh. D., *Dial.* iii.64 trsls “enjoy your possessions as you have been wont to do”; see note ibid.). We should favour a translation in the first sense  
   ■ *dubbhuttaṃ*, indigestible
