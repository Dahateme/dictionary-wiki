smith, a worker in metals generally DN.ii.126, AN.v.263; a silversmith Snp.962; Dhp.239; Ja.i.223; a goldsmith Ja.iii.281; Ja.v.282. The smiths in old India do not seem to be divided into black\-, gold\-and silver\-smiths, but seem to have been able to work equally well in iron, gold, and silver, as can be seen e.g. from Ja.iii.282 and Vv\-a.250, where the smith is the maker of a needle. They were constituted into a guild, and some of them were well\-to\-do as appears from what is said of Cunda at DN.ii.126; owing to their usefulness they were held in great esteem by the people and king alike Ja.iii.281.
