Pāli (Pāḷi)

feminine

1. a line, row Dāvs iii.61; Dāvs iv.3; Vism.242 (dvattiṃs’ ākāra˚), Vism.251 (danta˚); Snp\-a.87.
2. a line, norm thus the canon of Buddhist writings; the text of the Pāli Canon, i.e. the original text (opp. to the Commentary; thus “pāliyaṃ” is opposed to “aṭṭhakathāyaṃ” at Vism.107, Vism.450, etc). It is the literary language of the early Buddhists, closely related to Māgadhī. See Grierson, *The Home of Lit. Pāli* (Bhandarkar Commemoration vol. p. 117 sq.), and literature given by Winternitz, *Gesch. d. Ind. Litt.*, ii.10; iii.606, 635. The word is only found in Commentaries, not in the Piṭaka See also Hardy, *Introd. to Nett*, p. xi  
   ■ Ja.iv.447 (˚nayena accord. to the Pāli Text); Vism.376 (˚nay’ anusārena id.), Vism.394, Vism.401, Vism.565 (˚anusārato accord. to the text of the Canon); Vism.607, Vism.630, Vism.660 sq., Vism.693, Vism.712; Kp\-a.41; Snp\-a.333, Snp\-a.424, Snp\-a.519, Snp\-a.604; Dhs\-a.157, Dhs\-a.168; Dhp\-a.iv.93; Vv\-a.117, Vv\-a.203 (pālito \+ aṭṭhuppattito); Pv\-a.83, Pv\-a.87, Pv\-a.92 Pv\-a.287; and freq. elsewhere.

* *\-[vaṇṇanā](vaṇṇanā.md)* is explanation of the text (as regards meaning of words), purely textual criticism, as opposed to *vinicchaya\-kathā* analysis, exegesis, interpretation of sense Vb.291; Vism.240 (contrasted to bhāvanāniddesa).
