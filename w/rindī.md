at Thig.265 is doubtful. The T. reading is “te *rindī va* lambante ‘nodaka,” said of breasts hanging down in old age. The C. compares them with leather water bottles without water (udaka\-bhastā viya). We have to read either with Morris, *J.P.T.S.* 1884, 94 “*rittī va*” (= rittā iva), “as it were, empty,” or (preferably) with Thag\-a.212 “*therī ti va*” (“like an old woman”). The translation (*Sisters*, p. 124) takes the C expln of *udaka\-bhastā* as equivalent to T. reading *rindi*, in saying “shrunken as skins without water”; but *[rindī](rindī.md)* is altogether doubtful & it is better to read; *[therī](therī.md)* which is according to the context. We find the same meaning of therī (“old woman”) at Pv.ii.11#6.
