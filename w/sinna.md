1. wet with perspiration Vin.i.46, Vin.i.51; Vin.ii.223.
2. boiled (cp. siddha1) esp in the comp. *udaka\-sinna\-paṇṇa*; it occurs in a series of passages Ja.iii.142, Ja.iii.144; Ja.iv.236, Ja.iv.238, where Fausböll reads sitta, although the var. readings give also sinna. The English translation, p. 149, says “sprinkled with water,” but the text, 238, speaks of leaves which are “sodden” (sedetvā).

pp. of sijjati; Vedic svinna
