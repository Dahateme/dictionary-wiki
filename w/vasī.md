Vasī˚

is the composition form of *[vasa](vasa.md)* in combination with roots *kṛ*; and *[bhū](bhū.md)*, e.g. *\-kata* made dependent, brought into somebody’s power, subject(ed) Thig.295 (= vasavattino katvā, pl.); Snp.154; cp. BSk. vaśīkṛta Jtm.213. See also *vasagata \-˚katvā* having overcome or subjected Snp.561 (= attano vase vattetvā Snp\-a.455). Metricausâ as *vasiṃ karitvā* at Snp.444  
■ *\-bhāva* state of having power mastery Cnd.466 *(balesu);* Pp.14 (in same passage, but reading *phalesu*), explained at Pp\-a 189 (with variant reading SS *balesu!*) as “ciṇṇa\-vasī\-bhāva”; Kv.608 (implies *balesu*); Mil.170. Cp. BSk. bala\-vaśī\-bhāva Mvu.iii.379. See also ciṇṇa  
■ *\-bhūta* having become a master (over), mastering SN.i.132; Mil.319; cp. Mvu.i.47 & Mvu.i.399 vaśībhūta  
■ The same change of vasa˚ to vasī˚ we find in combn vasippatta (vasī \+ ppatta), q. v under *[vasi˚](vasi˚.md)*.
