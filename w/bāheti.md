Bāheti1

to keep away, to keep outside, to ward off; only with ref. to *[pāpa](pāpa.md)* (pāpaka) to keep away (from) sin SN.i.141 (bāhetvā pāpāni); Snp.519 = Cnd.464#a (bāhetvā pāpakāni); Dhp.267; a popular etymology of brāhmaṇa (pāpaṃ bahenti) DN.iii.94 (bāhitvā, better bāhetvā, explained by panuditvā Dhp\-a.iii.393; variant reading K vāh˚)
