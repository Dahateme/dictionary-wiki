indeclinable possible (lit. one might be able to); in the older language still used as a Pot., but later reduced to an adv. with infin. E.g. *sakkā sāmaaññphalaṃpaññāpetuṃ* would one be able to point out a result of samaṇaship DN.i.51; *khādituṃ na sakkā*, one could not eat Ja.ii.16; *na sakkā maggo akkhātuṃ*, the way cannot be shown, Mil.269; *sakkā etaṃ mayā ñātuṃ?* can I ascertain this? DN.i.187; *sakkā honti imāni aṭṭha sukhāni vindituṃ*, these eight advantages are able to be enjoyed Ja.i.8; *sakkā etaṃ abhavissa kātuṃ*, this would be possible to do, DN.i.168; *imaṃ sakkā gaṇhituṃ*, this one we can take Ja.iv.219. See also Snp\-a.338, Snp\-a.376 (= labbhā) Pv\-a.12, Pv\-a.69, Pv\-a.96.

originally Pot. of sakkoti = Vedic śakyāt; cp. Prk. sakkā with Pischel’s expln in *Prk. Gr.* § 465. A corresponding formation, similar in meaning, is *[labbhā](labbhā.md)* (q.v.)
