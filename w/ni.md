Ni˚

Nearly all (ultimately prob. all) words under this heading are compounds with the pref. ni.

### A. *Forms* ###

1. Pāli *[ni˚](ni˚.md)*; combines the two prefixes *ni*, *nis* (nir). They are outwardly to be distinguished inasmuch as *ni* is usually followed by a single consonant (except in forms where double cons. is usually restored in composition, like ni\-kkhipati = ni \+ *kṣip*; nissita ni \+ *sri*. Sometimes the double cons. is merely graphic or due to analogy, esp. in words where ni\-is contrasted with *ud\-* (“up”), as nikkujja → ukkujja, niggilati → uggilati, ninnamati → unnamati). On the other hand a compound with *nis* is subject to the rules of assimilation viz. either *doubling* of cons. (nibbhoga = nir\-bhoga where *vv* is represented by *bb* (nibbiṇṇa fr. nir\-vindati) or lengthening of ni to *nī* (nīyādeti as well as niyy˚ nīharati = nir \+ *har*), or *single* cons. in the special cases of *r & v;* (niroga besides nīroga for nirroga, cp. duratta → dūrakkha; niveṭheti = nibbeṭheti, nivāreti = \*nivvāreti = nīvāreti). Before a vowel the sandhi\-cons. *r* is restored: nir\-aya, nir\-upadhi etc.
2. Both ni & nis are base\-prefixes only, & of stable, well\-defined character i.e. never enter combinations with other prefixes as first (modifying) components in verb\-function (like saṃ, vi etc.), although *nis* occurs in such combination in noun\-cpds negating the *whole* term: nir\-upadhi, nis\-saṃsaya etc.
3. *ni* is freq. emphasised by *saṃ* as saṃni˚ (tud, dhā pat, sad); *nis* most freq. by *abhi* as abhinis˚ (nam, pad vatt, har).

### B. *Meanings* ###

1. *ni* (with secondary derivations like nīca “low”) is a verb\-pref. only, i.e. it characterises action with respect to its direction, which is that of (a) a *downward* motion (opp. abhi & ud); (b) often implying the aim (= down into, on to, cp. Lat. sub in subire, or pref. ad˚); or(c) the reverting of an upward motion = back (identical with b); e.g. (a) ni\-dhā (put down), ˚kkhip (throw d.), ˚guh (hide d.), ˚ci (heap up) ˚pad (fall d.), ˚sad (sit d.); (b) ni\-ratta (*at*\-tached to) ˚mant (speak to); ˚yuj (ap\-point), ˚ved (ad\-dress), ˚sev (be devoted to) etc.; (c) ni\-vatt (turn back).
2. *nis*
   1. as verb\-pref. it denotes the directional “out” with further development to “away from, opposite, without, pointing out the finishing, completion or vanishing of an action & through the latter idea often assuming the meaning of the reverse, disappearance or contrary of an action = “un” (Lat. dis\-), e.g. nikkhamati (to go out from) opp. pavisati (to enter into), ˚ccharati (nis to *car* to go forth), ˚ddhamati (throw out), ˚pajjati (result from), ˚bbattati (*vatt* spring out from), nīharati (take out), nirodhati (break up, destroy)
   2. as noun\-pref it denotes “being without” or “not having” E. *\-less*, e.g. niccola without clothes, ˚ttaṇha (without thirst), ˚ppurisa (without a man), ˚pphala (without fruit); niccala motion\-less, ˚kkaruṇa (heartless), ˚ddosa (fault˚), ˚maṃsa (flesh˚), ˚saṃsaya (doubt˚) nirattha (useless), ˚bbhaya (fear˚)  
      ■ Bdhgh evidently takes *ni\-* in meaning of *nis* only, when defining: ni\-saddo abhāvaṃ dīpeti Vism.495.

Sk. ni\- & nih\-, insep. prefixes: (a) ni down = Av. ni, cp. Gr.; νειός lowland, νείατος the lowest, hindmost Lat. nīdus (\*ni\-zdos: place to sit down = nest); Ags nēol, nider = E. nether; Goth. nidar = Ohg. nidar; also Sk. nīca, nīpa etc (b) *niḥ* out, prob. fr. \*seni & to Lat. sine without
