nom. also khattiyāse Ja.iii.441. A shortened form is khatya Ja.vi.397  
■ f. khattiyā AN.iii.226–⁠AN.iii.229, khattī DN.i.193, and khattiyī. A member of one of the clans or tribes recognised as of Aryan descent. To be such was to belong to the highest social rank. The question of such social divisions in the Buddha’s time is discussed in *Dialogues* i.97–107and it is there shown that whenever they are referred to in lists the khattiyas always come first. *Khattiyo seṭṭho jane tasmiṃ* DN.i.199 = DN.ii.97 = MN.i.358 = SN.i.153 SN.ii.284. This favourite verse is put into the mouth of a god; and he adds that whoever is perfect in wisdom and righteousness is the best of all. On the social prestige of the khattiyas see further MN.ii.150–MN.ii.157, MN.iii.169; AN.ii.86; SN.i.71, SN.i.93; Vin.iv.6–Vin.iv.10. On the religious side of the question DN.iii.82; DN.iii.93; MN.i.149, MN.i.177 MN.ii.84; SN.i.98. Wealth does not come into consideration at all. Only a very small percentage of the khattiyas were wealthy in the opinion of that time and place. Such are referred to at SN.i.15. All kings and chieftains were khattiyas DN.i.69, DN.i.136; DN.iii.44, DN.iii.46, DN.iii.61; AN.i.106 AN.iii.299; AN.iv.259. Khattiyas are called rājāno Dhp.294 quoted Ne.165.
