The context shows that the word is an epithet of an Arahant, and that non\-Buddhists were supposed to know what it meant.

Mrs. Rhys Davids (Dhs. tr. 1099, quoting Chalmers *J.R.A.S.* Jan., 1898 suggests “he who has won through to the truth.” Had the early Buddhists invented a word with this meaning it would probably have been tathaṃgata, but not necessarily, for we have upadhī\-karoti as well as upadhiṃ karoti
