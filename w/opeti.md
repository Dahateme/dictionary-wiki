throws into, heaps up (in)

--------------------

``` toml
dict_label = "PTS"
word = "opeti"
summary = "to deposit, receive (syn. with osāpeti) SN.i.236 ("
see_also = ["i", "ta"]
```

to deposit, receive (syn. with osāpeti) SN.i.236 (SA na… pakkhipanti) = Thig.283; Ja.v.252 (T. upeti); in which Thig.283 has *oseti* (Thag\-a.216, with expln. of oseti = ṭhapeti on p. 219)  
aor opi Ja.iv.457 (ukkhipi gloss); Ja.vi.185 (= pakkhipi gloss). ger. *opitvā* (opetvā?) Ja.iv.457 (gloss khipetvā).

unless we here deal with a very old misspelling for oseti we have to consider it a secondary derivation from opiya in Caus. sense, i e. Caus. fr. upa \+ *[i](i.md)*. Trenckner *Notes* 77, 78 offers an etym. of ā \+ vapati, thus opiya would be \*āvupiya, a risky conclusion, which besides being discrepant in meaning (āvapati = to distribute) necessitates der. of opiya fr. opati (\*āvapati) instead of vice versā. There is no other instance of \*āva being contracted to o Trenckner then puts opiya = ūpiya in tadūpiya (“conform with this”, see *[ta](ta.md)*˚ Ia), which is however a direct derivation from upa = upaka, upiya, of which a superl formation is upamā (“likeness”). Trenckner’s expln. of ūpiya as der. fr. ā \+ *vap* does not fit in with its meaning to make go into (c. loc.)
