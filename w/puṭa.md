In puṭa\-baddha\-kummāsa Vv\-a.308 perhaps meaning “cup.”
2. a bag or sack, usually referring to food carried for a journey, thus “knapsack” (or directly “provisions,” taking the container for what it contains DN\-a.i.288 puts puṭaṃsa pātheyya), in *bhatta˚*; bag with provisions Ja.ii.82 (with bandhati), Ja.ii.203; Ja.iii.200; DN\-a.i.270.

*\-[aṃsa](aṃsa.md)* “bag\-shoulder” (for “shoulder\-bag,” cp aṃsapuṭa (assapuṭa) & Ger. rucksack = knapsack Rightly expld by Bdhgh at DN\-a.i.288), a bag carrying provisions on journeys, hence “provision,” in phrase *puṭaṃsena* with provisions (variant reading at all places *puṭosena* DN.i.117; MN.iii.80; AN.ii.183; cp. *Dialogues* i.150; see also *[mutoḷī](mutoḷī.md)*

Vv.8452, 53). *\-[bhedana](bhedana.md)* breaking of the (seed\-) boxes of the Pāṭali plant, referring primarily to the Name of Pāṭali\-putta, where putta represents a secondary Pālisation of Sk. ˚putra which again represents P (or Non\-Aryan) puṭa (see Pischel, *Prk. Gr.* § 238 292). Through popular etym. a wrong conception of the expression arose, which took puṭa in the sense of “wares, provisions, merchandise” (perhaps influenced by puṭaṃsa) and, based on C. on Ud.88 (bhaṇḍakānaṃ mocara\-ṭṭhānaṃ vuttaṃ hoti) gave rise to the (wrong translation *Dial.* ii.92 “a centre for interchange of all kinds of *wares.*” See also *Mil translation* i.2; *Buddh. Suttas* xvi  
■ Vin.i.229 = DN.ii.87 = Ud.88. After the example of Pāṭaliputta applied to the city of Sāgala at Mil.1 (nānā\-puṭa\-bhedanaṃ S˚ nagaraṃ). Here clearly meant for “merchandise.”\-Rh. D. in a note on puṭabhedana gives expln “a town at the confluence or bend of a river” (cp. Jaina Sūtras 2, 451).

etym. unknown, prob. dialectical, as shown by Name of Pāṭaliputta, where putta = puṭa since unfamiliar in origin
