is probably misreading for *apaciṇāti* (see apac˚ 2). As variant reading at Ja.v.339 (anapavinanto) for T. anupacinanto (expld. by avaloketi C.). Other vv.ll. are anuvi˚ & apavī˚ meaning “not paying attention”. The positive form we find as *[apavīṇati](apavīṇati.md)* “to take care of, to pay attention to (c. acc.) at MN.i.324, where Trenckner unwarrantedly assumes a special root *veṇ* (see Notes p. 781), but the vv.ll. to this passage (see MN.i.557) with apavīṇāti and apacinati confirm the reading apaciṇāti, as does the gloss apaloketi.
