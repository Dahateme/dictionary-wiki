# paṭikiṭṭha

``` toml
dict_label = "PTS"
word = "paṭikiṭṭha"
summary = "inferior, low, vile AN.i.286 = Dhp.i.144; in meani"
```

inferior, low, vile AN.i.286 = Dhp.i.144; in meaning “miserable” at Dhp\-a.ii.3 is perhaps better to be read with variant reading as *pakkiliṭṭha*, or should it be *paṭikuṭṭha?*
