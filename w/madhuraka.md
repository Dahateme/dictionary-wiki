adjective full of sweet drink, intoxicated, in phrase *madhuraka\-jātokāyo viya* “like an intoxicated body, i.e. without control, weak. The usual translation has been “become languid or weak” (“erschlafft” Ger.) Franke, *Dīgha Übs.* 202 (where more literature) translates: “Ich fūhlte mich schwach, wie ein zartes *Pflänzchen*,” hardly justifiable  
■ DN.ii.99; MN.i.334; SN.iii.106; AN.iii.69. The description refers to a state of swooning like one in a condition of losing consciousness through intoxication. Rh. D. (*Dial.* ii.107) translates “my body became weak as a *creeper*,” hardly correct.

taken as *noun* also by Winternitz (*Rel. gesch. Lesebuch* 301) “wohl eine zarte Pflanze mit schwachen Stengel.” F. L. Woodward follows me in discarding translation “creeper” and assuming one like “intoxicated” (so also Ud\-a.246): see his note on SN.iii.106 translation (*K.S.* iii.90).

fr. madhura, cp. similarly madhuka → madhu
