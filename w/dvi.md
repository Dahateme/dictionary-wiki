number two.

### A. *Meanings* ###

#### I. *Two as unit* ####

1. with objective foundation:
   1. denoting a combination (pair, couple) or a repetition (twice). In this conn. frequent both objective & impersonal in mentioning natural pairs as well as psychologically contrasted notions. E.g. dvipad (biped), nāgassa dve dantā (elephants’ tusks), cakkhūni (eyes); dvija (bird), duvija (tooth), dijivha (snake) See also dutiya & dvaya  
      ■ dve: kāmā, khiḍḍā, gatiyo (Snp.1001), dānāni (Iti.98), piyā, phalāni (Snp.896; Iti.39), mittā, sinehā etc. See Nd ii.under dve, cp. AN.i.47 AN.i.100; DN.iii.212–⁠DN.iii.214
   2. denoting a separation (in two, twofold etc.): see *[dvidhā](dvidhā.md)* & compounds

2. with symbolic, sentimental meaning:
   1. *only* two (i.e. next to one or “next to nothing”), cp. the two mites of the widow (Mark xii. 42), two sons of Rachel (Gen. 30) dumāsika not more th an.2 months (Vin.ii.107); dvemāsiko gabbho (Pv.i.6#7); dvevācika; duvangula (see below)
   2. *a few* more than one, some, a couple (often intermediate between 1 & 3, denoting more than once, or a comparatively long, rather long, but not like 3 a; *very* long time): māsadvayaṃ a couple of months dvisahassa dīpā 2000 islands (= a large number) diyaḍḍhasata 150 = very long etc.; dvīhatīha (2 or 3 a couple of days) q.v.; dvirattatiratta (id. of nights) dvīsu tīsu manussesu to some people (Pv\-a.47); dvatikkhattuṃ soveral times; cp. dvikkhattuṃ (more than once), dutiyaṃ (for the second time).

#### II. Two as unit ####

*in connection with* its own & other.

*decimals* means a complex *plus* a pair, which amounts to the same as a large & a small unit, or so to speak “a year & a day.” E.g. *12* (sometimes, but rarely 10 \+ 2, see sep.); \- *32*: rests usually on 4 × 8, but as No. of the Mahāpurisa\-lakkhaṇāni it denotes 30 \+ 2 the great circle plus the decisive (invisible) pair; \- *62* views of heresy: see *[diṭṭhi](diṭṭhi.md)*; also as a year of eternity 60 kappas \+ 2; \- *92*: as measure of eternity = 90 \+ 2 kappas = a year & a day.

#### III. *Number twelve* ####

1. Based on natural phenomena it denotes the solar year (dvādasamāsako saṃvaccharo Vv\-a.247).
2. Connected with the solar cult it is used with human arrangements to raise them to the level of heavenly ones and to impart to them a superior significance. Thus:
   1. as denoting a *set* (cp. 12 months = companions of the Sun) it is the No. of a respectful holy, venerable group (cp. 12 sons of Jacob Gen. 35, 22 cakes as shewbread Lev. 25, 5; stones erected Josh. 4 8; apostles Math. 10, 2; patriarchs Acts 7, 8; companions of Odysseus Hom. Od. 9, 195; Knights of Arthur etc.): of theras, accompd by 12 bhikkhus Pv\-a.67, Pv\-a.141. 179 etc.; dvādasa koṭisatāni Snp.677; five groups of 12 musicians Vv\-a.96 (cp. 5 × 12 cromlechs in the outer circle of Stonehenge)
   2. as *measure* of distance in space & time it implies vast extent great importance, a climax, divine symmetry etc 12 yojanas wide extends the radiance Vv\-a.16 Vv\-a.12 y. as respectful distance Pv\-a.137 (cp. 2000 cubits in same sense at Josh. 3, 4); Pv\-a.12 y. in extent (height breadth & length) are the heavenly palaces of the Vimāna\-petas or Yakkhas Vv.55#1; Ja.vi.116; Vv\-a.6 Vv\-a.217, Vv\-a.244, Vv\-a.291, Vv\-a.298 etc. In the same connection we freq. find the No. 16: solasa\-yojanikaṃ kanaka\-vimānaṃ Vv.67#1; Vv\-a.188, Vv\-a.289 etc  
      ■ Of *years:* Ja.iii.80; Vv\-a.157 (dvādasa\-vassikā; in this sense also 16 instead of 12 soḷasa\-vassuddesika Vv\-a.259 etc. See soḷasa).
