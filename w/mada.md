1. intoxication, sensual excess, in formula *davāya madāya maṇḍanāya* (for purposes of sport, excess, personal charm etc. MN.i.355 = AN.ii.40 = Mnd.496 = Cnd.540 = Pp.21 = Dhs.1346, Dhs.1348. The commentator’s explains bearing directly or indirectly on this passage distinguish several kinds of *[mada](mada.md)*, viz. *māna\-mada & purisa\-;* mada (at Dhs\-a.403 Vism.293), or *muṭṭhika\-mall’* ādayo viya madatthaṃ *bala\-* mada\-nimittaṃ *porisa\-* mada\-nimittañ cā ti vuttaṃ (at Vism.31). Snp.218 (mada\-pamāda on which passage Snp\-a.273 comments on mada with jāti\-mad’ ādi\-bhedā madā).
2. (as mental state or habit) pride, conceit Mil.289 (māna, m., pamāda); Vb.345 (where 27 such states are given, beginning with jāti˚, gotta˚, ārogya˚ yobbana˚, jīvita\-mada), Vb.350 (where mada is paraphrased by majjanā majjitattaṃ māno… uṇṇati… dhajo sampaggāho ketukamyatā cittassa: same formula, as concluding exegesis of *[māna](māna.md)* at Cnd.505; Dhs.1116); sometimes more def. characterised with phrase *mada\-matta* elated with the pride or intoxication of… (\-˚). e.g. AN.i.147 (yobbana˚, ārogya˚ jīvita˚); Pv\-a.86 (māna˚), Pv\-a.280 (bhoga˚)  
   ■ The traditional exegesis distinguishes only 3 mada’s, viz. *ārogya\-* mada the pride of health, *yobbana˚*; of youth, *jīvita˚*; of life: DN.iii.220; AN.i.146.

* *\-[nimmadana](nimmadana.md)* “disintoxication from intoxication, freedom from pride or conceit AN.ii.34; Bv.i.81; Vism.293.

Vedic mada, *mad* (see *[majjati](majjati.md)*), Idg. *\*mad*, as in Av. mata intoxication, drink, mad, to get intoxicated orig. meaning “drip, be full of liquid or fat”; cp. Gr. μαδάω dissolve, μαστός breast (μαζός → Amazone), Lat madeo to be wet, Ohg. mast fattening, Sk. meda grease fat, Gr. μέζεα· μεστός full; Goth. mats eatables, Ags mōs, Ohg. muos = gemüse, etc. Perhaps connected with *\*med* in Lat. medeor to heal. For further relations see Walde, *Lat. Wtb.* s. v. madeo
