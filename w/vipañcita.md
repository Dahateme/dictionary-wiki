only in phrase *\-ññū* either: *knowing* diffuseness or detail, or: of unillusioned understanding, clear\-minded, unprejudiced combined with ugghaṭita\-ññū at AN.ii.135 = Pp.41 (trsld by B. C. Law as “learning by exposition”; Pp\-a 223 explains as “vitthāritaṃ atthaṃ jānāti,” i.e. one who knows a matter explained in detail. The spelling at AN.ii.135 is vipacita˚; at Pp.41 vipaccita˚ & at PugA vipaccita˚ with variant reading vipañcita˚); Ne.7 sq., Ne.125; Snp\-a.163 (where *ugghaṭita\-ññū* is applied to those who understand by condensed instruction, sankhepa\-desanāya, and vipañcita\-ññū to those who need a detailed one, vitthāradesanā; thus *“learning by diffuseness”*)  
■ At Ne.9 we have the var. terms *vipañcanā, vipañcayati vipañciyati;* (Denom.) used in the description of var ways of parsing and grammatical analysis. Here *vipañcanā* (resting clearly on Sk. papañca expansion means “expanding” (by letters & vowels) and stands midway between; *ugghaṭanā & vitthāraṇā* “condensing & detailing.” The term *vipañcayati* (= vipañciyati) is used in the same way  
■ *Note.* The term is not sufficiently cleared up. It occurs in BSk. as *vipañcika* (e.g. Divy.319, Divy.391, Divy.475, where it is applied to “brāhmaṇā naimittikā” & trsld by Cowell as “sooth\-sayer”), and *vipañcanaka* (Divy.548?), with which cp. vipañcitājña at Lal.520. See remark on *vejjañjanika*.
