### A. *On term* ###

Indriya is one of the most comprehensive & important categories of Buddhist psychological philosophy & ethics meaning “controlling principle, directive force, élan, δύναμις” in the foll. applications:

1. with reference to sense\-perceptibility “faculty, function”, often wrongly interpreted as “organ”.
2. w. ref. to objective aspects of form and matter “kind, characteristic, determinating principle, sign mark” (cp. woman\-hood, hood = Goth. haidus “kind form”).
3. w. ref. to moods of sensation and
4. to moral powers or motives controlling action, “principle, controlling” force.
5. w. ref. to cognition & insight “category”. Definitions of indriya among others at Dhs\-a.119; cp *Expositor* 157; *Dhs trsl.* lvii; *Cpd.* 228, 229.

### B. *Classifications and groups* of indriyāni. ###

An exhaustive list comprises the indriyāni enumerated under A a\-e, thus establishing a canonical scheme of 22 Controlling Powers (bāvīsati indriyāni), running thus at Vb.122 sq. (see trsl. at *Cpd.* 175, 176); and discussed in detail at Vism.491 sq

1. *sensorial*
   1. cakkh\-undriya (“the eye which is a power”, Cpd. 228) the eye or (personal potentiality of vision,
   2. sot\-indriya the ear or hearing,
   3. *ghān˚*; nose or smell,
   4. *jivh˚*; tongue or taste,
   5. *kāy˚*; body\-sensibility,
   6. *man˚*; mind.

2. *material*
   1. *itth˚*; female sex or femininity,
   2. *puris˚*; male sex or masculinity
   3. *jīvit˚*; life or vitality.

3. *sensational*
   1. *sukh˚* pleasure,
   2. *dukkh˚*; pain,
   3. *somanasa˚*; joy,
   4. *domanass˚*; grief,
   5. *upekh˚*; hedonic indifference

4. *moral*
   1. *saddh˚*; faith,
   2. *viriy˚*; energy,
   3. *sat˚* mindfulness,
   4. *samādh˚*; concentration,
   5. *paññ˚* reason.

5. *cognitional*
   1. *anaññāta\-ñassāmīt˚*; the thought “I shall come to know the unknown”,
   2. *aññ˚* (= aññā) gnosis,
   3. *aññātā\-v˚*; one who knows

■ Jīvitindriya (no. 9) is in some redactions placed before itth (no. 7), e.g. at Pts.i.7, Pts.i.137

■ From this list are detached several groups, mentioned frequently and in various connections no. 6 manas (mano, man\-indriya) wavering in its function, being either included under a or (more frequently) omitted, so that the first set a is marked off as pañc’ indriyāni, the 6th being silently included (see below). This uncertainty regarding manas deserves to be noted. The foll. groups may be mentioned here viz 19 (nos. 1–⁠19) at Pts.i.137; Pts.i.10 (pañca rūpīni; pañca arūpīni) at Ne.69; three groups of five (nos 1, 5, 10, 14, 15, 19) at DN.iii.239, cp. DN.iii.278; four (group d without paññā, i.e. nos. 15, 18) at AN.ii.141; three (saddh˚, samādh˚, paññ˚, i.e. nos. 15, 18, 19) at AN.i.118 sq. Under aṭṭhavidhaṃ indriya\-rūpaṃ (*Cpd.* 159) or rūpaṃ as indriyaṃ “form which is faculty” Dhs.661 (cp *trsl.* p. 204) are understood the 5 sensitives (nos. 1, 5) the 2 six\-states (nos. 7, 8) and the vital force (no. 9) i.e. groups a & b of enumn.; discussed & defined in detail at Dhs.709, Dhs.717, Dhs.971, Dhs.973  
■ It is often to be guessed from the context only, which of the sets of 5 indriyāni (usually either group a or d) is meant. These detached groups are classed as below under C. f  
■ *Note.* This system of 22 indriyāni reflects a revised & more elaborate form of the 25 (or 23) categories of the Sānkhya philosophy, with its 10 elements, 10 indri, īni & the isolated position of manas.
