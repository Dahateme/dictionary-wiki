in its P. meaning uncertain whether identical with Sk. prapañca (pra \+ pañc to spread out; meaning “expansion, diffuseness, manifoldedness”; cp. papañceti & papañca 3) more likely, as suggested by etym & meaning of Lat. im\-ped\-iment\-um, connected with; *[pada](pada.md)*, thus perhaps originally “pa\-pad\-ya,” i.e. what is in front of (i.e. in the way of) the feet (as an obstacle)
