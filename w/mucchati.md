1. (spelt *[muccati](muccati.md)*) to become stiff, congeal, coagulate, curdle Dhp.71; Dhp\-a.ii.67.
2. to become infatuated DN.iii.43 (majjati \+)
3. only in Caus. *muccheti* to make sound, to increase in tone Ja.ii.249 (vīṇaṃ); Ja.iii.188 (id.)

pp mucchita.

*murch*, an enlargement of Vedic *mūr* to get stiff (as in mūra stupid, dull, cp. Gr. μωρός; Sk. mūrakha foolish). Used in 2 senses, viz. (a) to become stiff (b) (Caus.) to harden, increase in tone, make louder From (c) a fig. meaning is derived in the sense of to become dulled or stupid, viz. infatuated, possessed.; See also Lüders in *K.Z.* xlii.194 a. How far we are justified to connect Dhtp.216 *[mū](mū.md)* & 503; *mu* (“bandhane”) with this root is a different question. These 2 roots seem to be without connections  
■ *mūrch* itself is at Dhtp.50 defined with “mohe”
