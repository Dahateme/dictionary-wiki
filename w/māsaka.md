lit. a small bean, used as a standard of weight & value; hence a small coin of very low value. Of copper, wood & lac (Dhs\-a.318 cp. Kp\-a.37; jatu˚, dāru˚, loha˚); the suvaṇṇa˚ (golden m.) at Ja.iv.107 reminds of the “gold” in fairy tales. That its worth is next to nothing is seen from the descending progression of coins at Dhp\-a.iii.108 = Vv\-a.77, which, beginning with *kahāpaṇa, aḍḍha\-pāda*, places *māsaka & kāhaṇikā* next to *[mudhā](mudhā.md)* “gratis.” It only “counts” when it amounts to 5 māsakas  
■ Vin.iii.47 Vin.iii.67; Vin.iv.226 (pañca˚); Ja.i.112 (aḍḍha\-māsakaṃ na agghati is worth nothing); Ja.iv.107; Ja.v.135 (first a rain of flowers, then of māsakas, then kahāpaṇas); Dhp\-a.ii.29 (pañca\-māsakamattaṃ a sum of 5 m.); Pv\-a.282 (m \+ aḍḍha˚ half\-pennies & farthings, as children’s pocket\-money).
