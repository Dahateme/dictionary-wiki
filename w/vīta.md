Vīta1

adjective deprived of, free from, (being) without. In meaning and use cp. *vigata˚*. Very frequent as first part of a cpd., as e.g. the foll.:

* *\-accika* without a flame, i.e. glowing, aglow (of cinders), usually combined with
* *\-dhūma* “without smoke MN.i.365; SN.ii.99 (so read for *vītacchika*) = SN.iv.188 = MN.i.74; DN.ii.134; Ja.i.15, Ja.i.153; Ja.iii.447; Ja.v.135; Dhp\-a.ii.68; Vism.301.
* *\-[iccha](iccha.md)* free from desire Ja.ii.258.
* *\-[gedha](gedha.md)* without greed Snp.210, Snp.860, Snp.1100; Mnd.250; Cnd.606.
* *\-taṇha* without craving Snp.83, Snp.741, Snp.849, Snp.1041, Snp.1060; Mnd.211 Cnd.607.
* *\-[tapo](tapo.md)* without heat Ja.ii.450; «(d)dara fearless Thag.525; Dhp.385.
* *\-[dosa](dosa.md)* without anger Snp.12.
* *\-[macchara](macchara.md)* without envy, unselfish Snp.954; Mnd.444; Ja.v.398; Pv.iii.1#15.
* *\-[mada](mada.md)* not conceited Snp.328 cp. AN.ii.120.
* *\-[mala](mala.md)* stainless (cp. vimala) SN.iv.47, SN.iv.107; DN\-a.i.237; Mil.16.
* *\-[moha](moha.md)* without bewilderment Snp.13. I have to remark that the reading *vīta˚*; seems to be well established. It occurs very frequently in the Apadāna. Should we take it in meaning of “excessive”? And are we confronted with an attribute of osadhi, the morning star which points to Babylonian influence (star of the East)? As it occurs in the Vatthugāthās of the Pārāyanavagga, this does not seem improbable
* *\-[raṃsi](raṃsi.md)* rayless (?) Snp.1016 (said of the sun; the expression is not clear. One MS. of Nd ii.at this passage reads *pīta˚*; i.e. with yellow, i.e. golden, rays; which is to be preferred). Cp. note in Index to Snp\-a.
* *\-[rāga](rāga.md)* passionless Snp.11, Snp.507, Snp.1071; Pp.32; Pv.ii.4#7; Mil.76 and frequently elsewhere.
* *\-[lobha](lobha.md)* without greed Snp.10 Snp.469, Snp.494.
* *\-[vaṇṇa](vaṇṇa.md)* colourless Snp.1120.
* *\-[salla](salla.md)* without a sting SN.iv.64.
* *\-[sārada](sārada.md)* not fresh, not unexperienced i.e. wise Iti.123.
