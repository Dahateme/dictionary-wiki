### A. Prep. and pref. of direction & place: ###

1. as direction denoting a movement towards a definite end or goal up to, over, toward, to, on (see C 1a.)
2. as place where (prep. c. loc. or abs.) = on top of, above, over in; in addition to. Often simply deictic “here” (e.g. ajjhatta = adhi \+ ātman “this self here” (see C 1b).

adhi is freq. as modification pref., i.e. in loose compn. with n. or v. and as first part of a double prefixcpd, like ajjhā˚ (adhi \+ ā), adhippa˚ (adhi \+ pra), but never occurs as a fixed base, i.e. as 2nd part of a pref. cpd., like ā in paccā˚ (prati \+ ā), paryā˚ (pari \+ ā) or *ava* in paryava˚ (pari \+ ava) or *ud* in abhyud˚ (abhi ud), samud˚ (sam \+ ud). As such (i.e. modification) it is usually intensifying, meaning “over above, in addition quite, par excellence, super”\-(adhideva a super\-god, cp ati\-deva), but very often has lost this power & become meaningless (like E. up in “shut up, fill up, join up etc) esp. in double pref  
■ compounds (ajjhāvasati “to dwell here\-in = āvasati “to dwell in, to inhabit”) (see C 2)  
■ In the explains of P. Commentators adhi is often (sometimes far\-fetchedly) interpreted by abhibhū “overpowering” see e.g. C. on adhiṭṭhāti & adhiṭṭhita; and by virtue of this intens. meaning we find a close relationship between the prefixes *ati, adhi* and *abhi*, all interchanging dialectically so that P. adhi often represents Sk. ati or abhi; thus adhi → ati in adhikusala, ˚kodhita, ˚jeguccha, ˚brahmā adhi → abhi in adhippatthita, ˚pātcti, ˚ppāya, ˚ppeta ˚bādheti, ˚bhū, ˚vāha. Cp. also ati iv.
