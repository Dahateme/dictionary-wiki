Omāna1

disregard, disrespect, contempt Dhp\-a.ii.52 (\+ atimāna) Cp. foll. & see also; *[avamāna](avamāna.md)*.

fr. o \+ *man*, think. The Sk. avamāna is later

Omāna2

at Ja.ii.443 we read *ucce sakuṇa omāna* meaning ʻOh bird, flying high’. With the present material we see no satisfactory solution of this puzzle. There is a Burmese correction which is at variance with the commentary “flying”, the variant reading BB is *ḍemāna* (fr. *ḍī*). C. explains by caramāna gacchamāna. Müller, *P. Gr.* 99 proposes to read ḍemāna for omāna.
