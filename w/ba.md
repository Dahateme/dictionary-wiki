indeclinable the sound (& letter); *b*, often substituted for or replaced by *p (& ph):* so is *e.g.* in Bdhgh’s view pahuta the word bahuta, with p for b (Kp\-a.207), cp. bakkula badara, badālatā, baddhacara, bandhuka 2, bala, balīyati bahuka, bahūta, billa, bella; also paribandha for paripantha; phāla2. Also substituted for *v*, cp. bajjayitvā *variant reading* vajjetvā DAI, 4, and see under Nibb\-.
