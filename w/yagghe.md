indeclinable hortative part, used in addressing a (superior) person in the voc., followed by Pot. of jānāti, either 2nd jāneyyāsi, or 3rd sg. jāneyya; to be trsld somewhat like “look here, don’t you know, surely, you ought to know; now then; similarly to part. *yaṃ nu, yaṃ nūna & yaṃ hi*. The part. is found in the language of the Nikāyas only, thus indicating part of the oldest & original dialect. E.g.: y. bhante jāneyyāsi Vin.i.237; *yagghe* deva jāneyyāsi yo te puriso dāso… so… pabbajito do you know, Oh king DN.i.60 (trsl.: “*if it please* your majesty, do you know…”; DN\-a.i.169 explains as “codan’ atthe nipāto”) y. ayye jāneyyāsi MN.ii.62; mahārāja j. MN.ii.71; id SN.i.101; y. bhavan jāneyya SN.i.180  
■ The passage MN.ii.157 is somewhat doubtful where we find y. with the *ind.* and in var. forms (see *v*. l.) of yagghi & taggha “jānanti pana bhonto yagghe…,” with reply “na jānāma yagghe…” Perhaps the reading taggha would be preferable.

similar in formation & meaning to tagghe (q.v.). It is yaṃ (yad) \+ gha, the latter in a Māgadhised form ghe, whereas taggha (= tad \+ gha only occurs as such
