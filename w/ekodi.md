adjective concentrated attentive, fixed AN.iii.354; Mnd.478. Usually in compn. with *kṛ & bhū* (which points however to a form ekoda with the regular change of a to i in connection with these roots!), as ekodi *\-[karoti](karoti.md)* to concentrate MN.i.116; SN.iv.263; *\-bhavati* to become settled SN.iv.196; SN.v.144; *\-bhūta* concentrated Snp.975; *\-bhāva* concentration, fixing one’s mind on one point DN.i.37; DN.iii.78, DN.iii.131; AN.i.254; AN.iii.24 Vism.156 (expld. as eko udeti); Dhs.161 (cp. *Dhs trsln.* 46); Dhs\-a.169; Ne.89.

most likely eka \+ odi for odhi, see *[avadhi](avadhi.md)*2 & cp. avadahati, avadahana, lit. of one attention, limited to one point. Thus also suggested by Morris; J.P.T.S. 1885, 32 sq. The word was Sanskritised into ekoti, e.g. at Mvu.iii.212, Mvu.iii.213; Lal.147, Lal.439
