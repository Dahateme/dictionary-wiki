to become annoyed, to get angry (lit. to get heated): this meaning as translation of vi \+ *pac*, although not quite correct as *pac* means to “ripen” and is not ordinarily used of *heated* conditions. Since the word is not sufficiently cleared up, we refrain from a detailed discussion concerning *possible* explanations. It may suffice to point out that it occurs only in *Vinaya* (and in one sporadic passage SN.i.232) in standing combination *ujjhāyati khīyati vipāceti*, expressing annoyance or irritation about something; e.g. Vin.i.191; Vin.ii.85, Vin.ii.291; Vin.iv.64. The corresponding BSk. phrase is *avadhyāyati dhriyati* [to resist, *dhṛ* ] vivācayati, e.g. Divy.492. It is not quite clear *which* of the two versions is the older one. There may be underlying a misunderstood (dial.) phrase which was changed by popular analogy. The BSk phrase seems *a priori* the more intelligible one; if we take *vipāceti = vivāceti*, we should translate it as “to speak disparagingly.” Mrs. Rh. D at *K.S.* i.296 trsls as “were vexed and fretted and consumed with indignation “\-See remarks under *[khīyati](khīyati.md)* & cp.; *[vipaccatā](vipaccatā.md)*.

Caus. of vi \+ *pac*, or distorted fr. *vivāceti*?
