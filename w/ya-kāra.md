Ya\-kāra
1. the letter (or sound) y: Ja.i.430 (padasandhikara); Ja.iii.433 (vyañjana\-sandhi\-vasena gahita).
2. the letter (or syllable) *ya:* Ja.v.427 (nipāta\-matta). It is referred to at Vin.iv.7 as an ending implying ridiculing or insult, together with the ending *\-bha*. The Cy. means words like dāsiya gumbiya, bālya etc. where\-ya either denotes descendency or property, or stands for\-ka as diminutive (i.e. (disparaging) ending. The same applies to *\-bha*. Here at Vin.iv.7 this way of calling a person by means of adding *\-ya\-* or *\-[bha](bha.md)* to his name (cp. E. y in kid → kiddy etc.) is grouped with a series of other terms of insult (hīnā akkosā).
