the stars or constellations, a conjunction of the moon with diff. constellations, a lunar mansion or the constellations of the lunar zodiac, figuring also as Names of months & determinant factors of horoscopic and other astrological observation; further a celebration of the beginning of a new month, hence any kind of festival or festivity  
■ The recognised number of such lunar mansions is 27, the names of which as given in Sk. sources are the same in Pāli, with the exception of 2 variations (Assayuja for Aśvinī, Satabhisaja for Śatatāraka). enumerated at Abhp. 58–⁠60 as follows Assayuja [Sk. Aśvinī] Bharaṇī, Kattikā, Rohiṇī, Magasiraṃ [Sk. Mṛgaśīrṣa] Addā [Sk. Ārdrā], Punabbasu Phussa [Sk. Puṣya], Asilesā, Maghā, Pubba\-phaggunī [Sk. Pūrva\-phalgunī). Uttara˚, Hattha, Cittā [Sk Chaitra], Sāti [Svātī], Visākhā, Anurādhā, Jeṭṭhā Mūlaṃ, Pubb\-āsāḷha [˚āṣāḍha], Uttar˚, Savaṇa, Dhaniṭṭhā Satabhisaja [Śatatāraka], Pubba\-bhaddapadā Uttara˚, Revatī  
■ It is to be pointed out that the Niddesa speaks of 28 N. instead of 27 (Mnd.382: aṭṭhavīsati nakkhattāni), a discrepancy which may be accounted by the fact that one N. (the Orion) bore 2 names, viz. Mṛgaśīrṣa & Agrahayanī (see Plunkett; *Ancient Calendars* etc. p. 227 sq.)  
■ Some of these Ns. are more familiar & important than others, & are mentioned more frequently, e.g. Āsāḷha (Āsālhi˚) Ja.i.50 & Uttarāsāḷha Ja.i.63, Ja.i.82; Kattikā & Rohiṇī Snp\-a.456
