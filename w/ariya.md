When the commentators, many centuries afterwards began to write Pali in S. India & Ceylon, far from the ancient seat of the Aryan clans, the racial sense of the word; *[ariya](ariya.md)* was scarcely, if at all, present to their minds Dhammapāla especially was probably a non \-Aryan, and certainly lived in a Dravidian environment. The then current similar popular etmologies of *[ariya](ariya.md)* and *[arahant](arahant.md)* (cp. next article) also assisted the confusion in their minds. They sometimes therefore erroneously identify the two words and explain Aryans as meaning Arahants (Dhp\-a.i.230; Snp\-a.537; Pv\-a.60). In other ways also they misrepresented the old texts by ignoring the racial force of the word. Thus at Ja.v.48 the text, speaking of a hunter belonging to one of the aboriginal tribes, calls him *anariya\-rūpa*. The C. explains this as “shameless” but what the text has, is simply that he looked like a non\-Aryan. (cp ʻfrank’ in English).
