an irrigated field, prepared for ploughing, arable land in its first stage of cultivation: kedāre pāyetvā karissāma “we shall till the fields after watering them” Ja.i.215; as square\-shaped (i.e. marked out as an allotment) Vin.i.391 (caturassa˚; Bdhgh on MV viii.12, 1); Ja.iii.255 (catukkaṇṇa˚); surrounded by a trench, denoting the boundary (\-mariyādā) Dhp\-a.iii.6  
■ Ja.iv.167; Ja.v.35; Pv\-a.7 (= khetta). The spelling is sometimes ketāra (Ja.iii.255 variant reading) see Trenckner *J.P.T.S.* 1908, 112. *Note.* The prefix ke\-suggests an obsolete noun of the meaning “water,” as also in kebuka ke\-vaṭṭa; perhaps Sk. kṣvid, kṣvedate, to be wet, ooze? ke would then be k(h)ed, and kedara ked \+ *dṛ*; bursting forth of water = inundation; kebuka = kedvu(d)ka (udaka); kevaṭṭa = ked \+ *vṛ*; moving on the water, fisherman; (cp. Avs Index Kaivarta: name of an officer on board a trading vessel).

* *\-[koṭi](koṭi.md)* top or corner\-point of a field Vism.180.
