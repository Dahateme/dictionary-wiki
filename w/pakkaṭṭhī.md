boiling (\-hot) mixture (of oil?) MN.i.87, explained by C. as katita\-(= kaṭh˚) gomaya, boiling cow\-dung, variant reading *chakaṇakā* see p.537. The id. p. at Cnd.199 reads chakaṇaṭī, evidently a bona fide reading. The interpretation as “cow\-dung” is more likely than “boiling oil.”

fr. pa \+ *kvat*, evidently as abstr. to pakkaṭṭhita; reading uncertain
