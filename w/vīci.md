1. a wave Ja.i.509; Mil.117 (jala˚), Mil.319 (˚puppha wave\-flower fig.); Vism.63 (samudda˚); Dāvs iv.46; Dhs\-a.116 Vism.143.
2. interval, period of time (cp. “tide” time interval) Ja.v.271 (˚antara, in *Avīci* definition as “uninterrupted state of suffering”). In contrast pair *[avīci](avīci.md)* (adj.) uninterrupted, without an interval; *savīci* with periods, in defn of *[jarā](jarā.md)* at Vb\-a.99 & Dhs\-a.328, where; *[avīci](avīci.md)* means “not changing quickly,” and *savīci* “changing quickly.” Also in defn of *[sadā](sadā.md)* (continuously) as “avīci\-santati” at Cnd.631. Cp. avīci.

cp. late Sk. vīci wave; Vedic vīci only in meaning “deceit”; perhaps connected with Lat. vicis Ags. wīce = E. week, lit. “change,” cp. tide
