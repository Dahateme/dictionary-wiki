to churn, to shake, disturb, upset. Only in Caus. *matheti* to agitate, crush, harass, upset (cittaṃ SN.iv.210; Snp.50 (= tāseti hāpeti Cnd.492); Pv.iv.7#1 (kammānaṃ vipāko mathaye manaṃ; C 264: abhibhaveyya); Mil.385 (vāyu pādape mathayati;… kilesā mathayitabbā)  
pp *[mathita](mathita.md)*. See also *[abhimatthati](abhimatthati.md)* (sic) & *[nimmatheti](nimmatheti.md)*.

Vedic *math, manth* to twirl, shake about, stir etc.; cp. Lat. mamphur part of the lathe = Ger. mandel (“mangle”), E. mandrel; Lith. mentùris churning stick, Gr. μόχος tumult μόχουρα shaft of rudder. The Dhtp (126) gives both roots (math & manth) and explains by “viḷolana,” as does Dhtm (183) by “viḷoṭana”
