understanding, having penetrated

--------------------

``` toml
dict_label = "PTS"
word = "avecca"
summary = "adverb certainly, definitely, absolutely, perfectl"
see_also = ["i"]
```

adverb certainly, definitely, absolutely, perfectly, expld. by Bdhgh. as acala (on DN.ii.217), or as paññāya ajjhogahetvā (on Snp.229); by Dhp. as apara\-paccaya\-bhāvena (on Pv.iv.1#25)  
■ Usually in phrase *Buddhe Dhamme Saṅghe avecca\-pasādo* perfect faith in the B., the Dhamma & the Sangha, e.g. at MN.i.47; SN.ii.69; SN.iv.271 sq., SN.iv.304, SN.v.344, SN.v.405; AN.i.222; AN.ii.56; AN.iii.212, AN.iii.332, AN.iii.451; AN.iv.406 AN.v.183; further at Pts.i.161 (˚pasanna); Snp.229 (yo ariyasaccāni avecca passati); Pv.iv.1#25.

Usually taken as ava \+ ger. of *[i](i.md)* (\*itya), cp. adhicca & abhisamecca, but by P. grammarians as a vecca. The form is not sufficiently clear semantically B.Sk. avetya, e.g. Jtm. 210, is a Sanskritisation of the P. form
