kind of hemp DN.ii.350 (variant reading); SN.i.115 (do.); cp. *sāṇa1 & sāṇī*.

* *\-dhovika* [perhaps (Kern’s suggestion) sāṇa˚ (variant reading) visāṇa˚?] name of a particular kind of gambol of elephants in water MN.i.229, MN.i.375. Bdhgh at DN\-a.i.84 uses the obscure term *sāṇa\-dhovana\-kīḷā* to denote a trick of Caṇḍālas. But see *[sandhovika](sandhovika.md)*.

Vedic śaṇa; Gr. κάνναβις = Lat. cannabis; Ags haenep = E. hemp; Ger. hanf.
