touching, seizing, taking hold of MN.i.130 (variant reading ˚māsa which reading is probably to be preferred, cp. Trenckner on p. 541) SN.iii.46 (variant reading ˚māsa)  
■ neg. aparāmasa not leading astray, not enticing DN.i.17 (˚to), DN.i.202  
■ Perhaps we should read *[parāmāsa](parāmāsa.md)* altogether.

parā \+ *mṛś*, but see *[parāmāsa](parāmāsa.md)*
