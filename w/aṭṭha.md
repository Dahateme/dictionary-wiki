Aṭṭha1

*num. card*, eight, decl. like pl. of adj. in\-a A. The number in *objective* significance, based on natural phenomena: see compounds ˚angula, ˚nakha, ˚pada, ˚pāda B. The number in *subjective* significance

1. As mark of respectability and honour, based on the idea of the double square:
   1. in meaning “a couple” aṭṭha matakukkuṭe aṭṭha jīva\-k. gahetvā (with 8 dead & 8 live cocks; eight instead of 2 because gift intended for a king) Dhp\-a.i.213. sanghassa a salākabhattaṃ dāpesi Vv\-a.75 = Dhp\-a.iii.104. a. piṇḍapātāni adadaṃ Vv.34#8. a. vattha\-yugāni (a double pair as offering) Pv\-a.232, a therā Pv\-a.32  
      ■ The highest respectability is expressed by 8 × 8 = 64, and in this sense is freq. applied to *gifts*, where the giver gives a higher potency of a pair (23). Thus a “royal” gift goes under the name of *sabb\-aṭṭhakaṃ* dānaṃ (8 elephants, 8 horses 8 slaves etc.) where each of 8 constituents is presented in 8 exemplars Dhp\-a.ii.45, Dhp\-a.ii.46, Dhp\-a.ii.71. In the same sense aṭṭh’ aṭṭha kahāpaṇā (as gift) Dhp\-a.ii.41; aṭṭh\-aṭṭhakā dibbākaññā Vv.67#3 (= catusaṭṭhi Vv\-a.290); aṭṭhaṭṭhaka Dpvs.vi.56. Quite conspicuous is the meaning of a “couple” in the phrase satt\-aṭṭha 7 or 8 = a couple e.g. sattaṭṭha divasā, a weck or so Ja.i.86; Ja.ii.101; Vv\-a.264 (saṃvaccharā years)
   2. used as definite *measure* of quantity & distance, where it also implies the respectability of the gift, 8 being the lowest unit of items that may be given decently. Thus freq. as aṭṭha kahāpaṇā Ja.i.483; Ja.iv.138; Vv\-a.76; Mil.291  
      ■ In distances: a karīsā Dhp\-a.ii.80; Dhp\-a.iv.217; Pv\-a.258; a. usabhā Ja.iv.142.
   3. in combn. with 100 and 1000 it assumes the meaning of “a great many”, hundreds, thousands. Thus *aṭṭha sataṃ* 800, Snp.227. As denotation of wealt (cp. below under 18 and 80): a\-˚sata\-sahassa\-vibhava Dhp\-a.iv.7. But aṭṭhasata at SN.iv.232 means 108 (3 × 36), probably also at Ja.v.377  
      ■ *aṭṭha sahassaṃ* 8000; Ja.v.39 (nāgā). The same meaning applies to *80* as well as to its use as unit in combn. with any other decimal (18, 28, 38 etc.):
      1. *80 (asīti)* a great many. Here belong the 80 smaller signs of a Mahāpurisa (see *[anuvyañjana](anuvyañjana.md)*), besides the 32 main signs (see dvattiṃsa) Vv\-a.213 etc. Freq. as measure of *riches*, e.g. 80 waggon loads Pv.ii.7#5; asīti\-koṭivibhava Dhp\-a.iii.129; Pv\-a.196; asīti hatth’ ubbedho rāsi (of gold Vv\-a.66, etc. See further references under asīti
      2. The foll. are examples of 8 with other decimals:  
         ■ *18 aṭṭhādasa* (only MN.iii.239: manopavicārā) & *[aṭṭhārasa](aṭṭhārasa.md)* (this the later form) Vv\-a.213 (avenika\-buddhadhammā: Bhagavant’s qualities);  
         ■ as measure Ja.vi.432 (18 hands high, of a fence);  
         ■ of a great mass or multitude: aṭṭhārasa koṭiyo or ˚koṭi, 18 koṭis Ja.i.92 (of gold), Ja.i.227; Ja.iv.378 (˚dhana riches); Dhp\-a.ii.43 (of people); Mil.20 (id.); a. akkhohini\-sankhāsenā Ja.vi.395. a. vatthū Vin.ii.204  
         ■ 28 *aṭṭhavīsati* nakkhattāni Mnd.382; paṭisallāṇaguṇā Mil.140  
         ■ 38 *aṭṭhatiṃsā* Mil.359 (rājaparisā)  
         ■ 48 *aṭṭhacattārīsaṃ* vassāni Snp.289  
         ■ 68 *aṭṭhasaṭṭhi* Thag.1217 ˚sitā savitakkā, where id. p. at SN.i.187 however reads atha saṭṭhi\-tasitā vitakkā); Ja.i.64 (turiya\-satasahassāni)  
         ■ 98 *aṭṭhanavuti* (cp. 98 the age of Eli, 1 Sam. iv.15); Snp.311 (rogā, a higher set than the original 3 diseases cp. navuti)

2. As number of *symmetry* or of an intrinsic, harmonious, symmetrical set, aṭṭha denotes, like dasa (q.v.) a comprehensive unity. See esp. the cpds for this application. *\-aṃsa* and *\-aṅgika*. Closely related to nos. 2 and 4. aṭṭha is in the geometrical progression of 2–4–8–16–32, where each subsequent number shows a higher symmetry or involves a greater importance (cp.8 × 8 under 1 a) Ja.v.409 (a. mangalena samannāgata of Indra’s chariot: with the 8 lucky signs); Vv\-a.193 (aṭṭhahi akkhaṇehi vajjitaṃ manussabhāvaṃ: the 8 unlucky signs). In progression: Ja.iv.3 (aṭṭha petiyo, following after 4, then foll. by 8, 16, 32); Pv\-a.75 (a. kapparukkhā at each point of the compass, 32 in all). Further: 8 expressions of bad language Dhp\-a.iv.3.
