Vedic dakṣa = Gr. ἀρι δείκετος & δεςιός; dakṣati to be able; to please, satisfy, cp. daśasyati to honour, Denom. fr. \*dasa = Lat. decus honour, skill All to *\*dek* in Lat. decet to be fit, proper, etc. On var theories of connections of root see Walde, *Lat. Wtb.* under decet. It may be that *\*deks* is an intens. formation fr. *\*diś* to point (see *[disati](disati.md)*), then the original meaning would be “pointing,” i.e. the hand used for pointing.
