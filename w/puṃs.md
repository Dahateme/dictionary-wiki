Of the simplex no forms are found in Pāli proper. The base; *[puṃ](puṃ.md)* occurs in pukusa (?), puggala (?), pungava pullinga; *[puṃs](puṃs.md)* in napuṃsaka (cp. Prk. napuṃsaveya Pischel, *Gram.* § 412). The role of puṃs as contrast to *[itthi](itthi.md)* has in Pāli been taken over by *[purisa](purisa.md)*, except in *itthi\-pumā* at the old passage DN.iii.85. The strong base is in P. *[puman](puman.md)* (q.v.). See also posa1.

Vedic puṃs (weak base) and pumāṃs (strong base), often opp. to strī (woman, female); cp. putra & potaka
