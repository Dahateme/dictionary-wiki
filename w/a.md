A\-1

the prep. *[ā](ā.md)* shortened before double cons., as *akkosati (ā \+ kruś), akkhāti (ā \+ khyā), abbahati (ā \+ bṛh)*

Best to be classed here is the *a\-* we call expletive. It represents a reduction of *ā\-* (mostly before liquids and nasals and with single consonant instead of double). Thus *anantaka* (for *ā\-nantaka = nantaka*) Vv.80#7; *[amajjapa](amajjapa.md)* (for *ā\-majjapa = majjapa*) Ja.vi.328; *amāpaya* (for *āmāpaya* = *māpaya*) Ja.vi.518; *apassato (= passantassa)* Ja.vi.552.

A\-2

(*an\-* before vowels) neg. part. prefixed to 1 nouns and adjectives; 2 verbal forms, used like (1) whether *part.*, *ger.*, *grd.* or *inf.*; 3 finite verbal forms. In compound. with words having originally two initial cons. the latter reappear in their assimilated form (e.g. appaṭicchavin). In meaning it equals *na\-*, *nir\-* and *vi\-*. Often we find it opp. to *sa\-*. Verbal negatives which occur in specific verb. function will be enumerated. separately, while examples of neg. forms of (1) & (2) are given under their positive form unless the neg. involves a distinctly new concept, or if its form is likely to lead to confusion or misunderstanding

Concerning the combining & contrasting (orig. neg.) *\-a\-(ā)* in redupl. formations like *bhavā\-bhava* see *[ā](ā.md)*4.

Vedic a\-, an\-; Idg. \*n̊, gradation form to \*ne (see *[na](na.md)*2); Gr. ἀ, ἀν\-; Lat. \*en\-, in\-; Goth. Ohg. & Ags. un\-; Oir. an\-, in\-

A\-3

the augment (sign of action in the past), prefixed to the root in *pret., aor. & cond.;* tenses; often omitted in ordinary prose. See forms under each verb; cp. also *[ajja](ajja.md)* Identical with this *a\-* is the *a\-* which functions as base of some pron. forms like *ato, attha, asu* etc. (q.v.).

Vedic a\-; Idg. \*e (loc. of pron. stem, cp. ayaṃ; orig. a deictic adv. with specific reference to the past, cp Sk sma); Gr. ἐ\-; also in Gr. ἐκεϊ, Lat. equidem, enim.

A\-4

the sound a (*a\-kāra*) Ja.vi.328, Ja.vi.552; Vv\-a.279, Vv\-a.307, Vv\-a.311.
