see_also = ["apakassati", "avapakāsati", "avakassati", "vavakassati"]
```

at Vin.ii.204 is to be read as *[apakassati](apakassati.md)* and interpreted as “draw away, distract, bring about a split or dissension (of the Sangha)”. The variant reading on p. Vin.ii.325 justifies the correction (apakassati) as well as Bdhgh’s expln. “parisaṃ ākaḍḍhanti”  
■ Cp. AN.iii.145 & see; *[avapakāsati](avapakāsati.md)* The reading at the id. p. at AN.v.74 is *[avakassati](avakassati.md)* (combd. w. vavakassati, where Vin.ii.204 has avapakāsati) which is much to be preferred (see *[vavakassati](vavakassati.md)*).
