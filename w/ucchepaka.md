connected with throwing away; involving what is thrown away.

--------------------

``` toml
dict_label = "PTS"
word = "ucchepaka"
summary = "leavings of food MN.ii.7 (variant reading uccepaka"
grammar_comment = "neuter"
```

leavings of food MN.ii.7 (variant reading uccepaka with cc for cch as ucciṭṭha: ucchiṭṭha). The passage is to be read ucchepake va te ratā. A diff. connotation would be implied by taking ucchepaka = uñchā, as Neumann does (Majjhima trsl.2 ii.682).

= ucchiṭṭhaka in sense of ucchiṭṭhabhatta
