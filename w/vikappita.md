prepared, put in order, arranged, made; in combination *su˚*; well prepared, beautifully set Snp.7; Vv\-a.188 (manohara \+)  
■ Bdhgh. at Snp\-a.21 interprets ˚kappita as *[chinna](chinna.md)* “cut,” saying it has that meaning from “kappita\-kesa\-massu” (with trimmed hair & beard), which he interprets; *ad sensum*, but not etymologically correctly. Cp. vikappeti 5.
