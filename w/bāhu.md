the arm Ja.iii.271 (bāhumā bāhuṃ pīḷentā shoulder to shoulder); Vism.192. *\-ṃ pasāreti* to stretch out the arm (cp. bāhaṃ) Pv\-a.112 *pacchā\-bāhuṃ* (cp. bāhaṃ) Pv\-a.4 (gāḷha\-bandhanaṃ bandhāpetvā).

* *\-(p)pacālakaṃ* (adv.) after the manner of one who swings his arms about Vin.ii.213 (see expln at Vin.iv.188).

cp. Vedic bāhu, prob. to bahati2; cp. Gr. π ̈ηξυς in same meaning, Ohg. buoc. It seems that bāhu is more frequent in later literature, whereas the by\-form *[bāhā](bāhā.md)* belongs to the older period
