orig. meaning “experience, concomitance” and found only in compounds as\-˚, in meaning “experiencing the sensation of or belonging to, experience of, accordance with”, e.g. maha˚ sensation of greatness rājâ˚ s. belonging to a king, what is in accordance with kingship, i.e. majesty. Through preponderance of expressions of distinction there arises the meaning of anubhāva as “power, majesty, greatness, splendour etc.” & as such it was separated from the 1st component and taken as *[ānubhāva](ānubhāva.md)* with ā instead of a, since the compositional character had obliterated the character of the a. As such (ānubhāva abs.) found only in later language
