```

furrowed, cut open, dug up, slashed torn (perhaps also “beaten”) MN.i.178 (hatthipadaṃ dantehi ārañjitaṃ an elephant\-track bearing the marks of tusks, i.e. occasional slashes or furrows).

in form = Sk. \*ārañjita, ā \+ pp. of rañjayati, Caus. of *rañj* or *raj*, but in meaning different. Perhaps to *rac* (as \*racita) to furnish with, prepare, or better still to be regarded as an idiomatic Pāli form of soundroot *\*rac* (see āracayā˚) mixed with *rañj*, of which we find another example in the double spelling of āracayā (& ārajayā) q.v.
