Puthutta (Puthatta)

neuter being at variance, diversity SN.ii.77 (opp ekatta; variant reading SS puthatta). At AN.iv.97 we have to read *puth’ attānaṃ* for puthuttānaṃ which has nothing to do with puthutta, but is puthu \+ attānaṃ as borne out by variant reading puthujj’ attānaṃ, and by AA: *[puthu](puthu.md)* nānākāraṇehi attānaṃ hanti.

fr. puthu, cp. Sk. \*pṛthutva; not with Kern,

 s. v. = Sk. pṛthaktva, speciality peculiarity
