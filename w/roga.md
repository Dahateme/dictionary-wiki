illness, disease  
■ The defn of roga at Ja.ii.437 is “roga rujana\-sabhāvattaṃ.” There are many diff enumerations of rogas and sets of standard combinations, of which the foll. may be mentioned. At sn.311 (cp DN.iii.75) it is said that in old times there were only 3 diseases, viz. *icchā, anasanaṃ, jarā*, which gradually through slaughtering of animals, increased to 98 Bdhgh at Snp\-a.324 hints at these 98 with “cakkhu\-rog adinā\-bhedena.” Beginning with this (cakkhuroga affection of the eye) we have a list of 34 rogas at Mnd.13 (under pākaṭa\-parissayā or open dangers = Mnd.360 Cnd.420) & Cnd.3041 B, viz. cakkhu˚ & the other 4 senses, sīsa˚, kaṇṇa˚, mukha˚, danta˚; kāsa, sāsa pināsa, ḍāha, jara; kucchiroga, mucchā, pakkhandikā sūlā, visūcikā; kuṭṭhaṃ, gaṇḍo, kilāso, soso, apamāro daddu, kaṇḍu, kacchu, rakhasā, vitacchikā, lohita pittaṃ, madhumeho, aṃsā, piḷakā, bhagandalā. This list is followed by list of 10 ābādhas & under “dukkha goes on with var. other “ills,” which however do not make up the number 98. The same list is found at AN.v.110. The 10 ābādhas (Cnd.304#1 C.) occur at AN.ii.87 & Mil.308 (as āgantuka\-rogā). The 4 “rogas of the Sun (miln 273, cp. Vin.ii.295) are: abbha, mahikā megha, Rāhu  
■ Another mention of roga together with plagues which attack the corn in the field is given at Ja.v.401, viz. visa\-vāta; mūsika\-salabha\-suka\-pāṇaka setaṭṭhika\-roga etc., i.e. hurtful winds, mice, moths parrots, mildew  
■ The combn *roga, gaṇḍa, salla* is sometimes found, e.g. MN.ii.230; Vism.335. Of other single rogas we mention: kucchi˚ (stomach\-ache) Ja.i.243 ahivātaka˚ Vin.i.78; Ja.ii.79; Ja.iv.200; Dhp\-a.i.231 paṇḍu˚ jaundice Vin.i.206; Ja.ii.102; Dhp\-a.i.25; tiṇapupphaka˚ hay\-fever Mil.216
