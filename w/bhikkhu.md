There are several allegorical *etymologies* (definitions of the word bhikkhu, which occur frequently in the commentaries. All are fanciful interpretations of the idea of what a bhikkhu is or should be, and these qualities were sought and found in the word itself Thus we mention here the foll.

1. bhikkhu = *bhinnakilesa* (“one who has broken the stains” i.e. of bad character) Vb\-a.328; Vv\-a.29, Vv\-a.114, Vv\-a.310; Pv\-a.51.
2. Another more explicit expln is “sattannaṃ dhammānaṃ bhinnattā bhikkhu” (because of the breaking or destroying of 7 things, viz. the 7 bad qualities leading to rebirth, consisting of sakkāyadiṭṭhi, vicikicchā sīlabbata\-parāmāsa, rāga, dosa, moha, māna) This def. at Mnd.70 = Cnd.477#a
3. Whereas in a & b the first syllable; *bhi*(\-kkhu) is referred to *bhid*, in this def. it is referred to *bhī* (to fear), with the further reference of (bh\-) *ikkh*(u) to *īkṣ* (to see) and bhikkhu defined as “saṃsāre bhayaṃ ikkhati ti bh.” Vism.3, Vism.16 (saṃsāre bhayaṃ ikkhaṇatāya vā bhinna\-paṭa\-dharaditāya vā)

■ A very comprehensive def. of the term is found at Vb.245–Vb.246, where bhikkhu\-ship is established on the ground of 18 qualities (beginning with samaññāya bhikkhu, paṭiññāya bh., bhikkhatī ti bh., bhikkhako ti bh., bhikkhācariyaṃ ajjhupagato ti bh., bhinna\-paṭa\-dharo ti bh., bhindati pāpake dhamme ti bh., bhinnattā pāpakānaṃ dhammānan ti bh. etc. etc.)  
■ This passage is explained in detail at Vb\-a.327, Vb\-a.328  
■ Two *kinds* of bhikkhus are distinguished at Pts.i.176; Mnd.465 = Cnd.477#b, viz *kalyāṇa[\-ka\-]puthujjana* (a layman of good character and *[sekkha](sekkha.md)* (one in training), for which latter the term paṭilīnacara (one who lives in elimination, i.e. in keeping away from the dangers of worldly life) is given at Mnd.130 (on Snp.810).

* *\-[gatika](gatika.md)* a person who associates with the bhikkhus (in the Vihāra) Vin.i.148.
* *\-[bhāva](bhāva.md)* state of being a monk, monkhood, bhikkhuship DN.i.176; Snp.p.102
* *\-[saṅgha](saṅgha.md)* the community of bhikkhus, the Order of friars DN.iii.208; Snp.403, Snp.1015; Snp.p.101, Snp.p.102; Mil.209; Pv\-a.19 sq. & passim.
