indeclinable

1. as conjunction: if; constructed either with *pres. indic.*, as: Snp.189; “yadi bodhiṃ pattuṃ icchasi” Ja.i.24 (v. 167); “yadi dāyako dānaṃ deti… etaṃ bījaṃ hoti” Pv\-a.8; or *pot.;* or with a *participle*, as: “yadi evaṃ sante” that being so, if this is so DN.i.61; “gahito yadi sīho te” if the lion is caught by you Mhvs.6, Mhvs.27  
   ■ With other particles, e.g. *yādi* āsanamattaṃ pi *even if* only a seat Vv\-a.39; *[yadi](yadi.md)*… atha kasmā if… how then Mil.4. yadi *[evaṃ](evaṃ.md)*… (tu) even if… yet (but) Pv\-a.63 (y. e. pitā na rodati mātu nāma hadayaṃ mudukaṃ)  
   ■ *yadi va* “or” (cp Vedic yadi vā “or be it that”) Dhp.195 (= yadi vā athavā Dhp\-a.iii.252). So *yadi vā* at Ja.i.18 (v. 97: latā vā yadi vā rukkhā etc. Snp.119 (gāme vā yadi vâraññe)
2. as a strong particle of *exhortation:* *yadi evaṃ* if so, in that case, let it be that, alright, now then Pv\-a.54 (y. e. yaṃ mayhaṃ desitaṃ ekassa bhikkhuno dehi), Pv\-a.217 (y. e. yāvadatthaṃ gaṇhāhi: take as much as you like).

adv. formation, orig. loc., fr. ya˚; cp. Vedic yadi
