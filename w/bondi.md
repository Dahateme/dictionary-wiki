body Pv.iv.3#32; Ja.i.503; Ja.ii.160; Ja.iii.117; Pv\-a.254.

etym. doubtful, one proposed by Morris, *J.P.T.S.* 1889, 207 derives it fr. *bandh = bundh* to bind, which is an erroneous comparison; on his hint “probably cognate with E. body” cp. Walde, *Lat. Wtb.* under fidelia. The orig. meaning may have been, as Morris suggests, “trunk.” It certainly is a dial. word
