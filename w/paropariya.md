# paropariya

``` toml
dict_label = "PTS"
word = "paropariya"
summary = "(˚ñāṇa) see under indriya˚. The form is paro + par"
see_also = ["indriya", "paro", "para", "parovara"]
```

(˚ñāṇa) see under *[indriya](indriya.md)*˚. The form is paro \+ pariya, *[paro](paro.md)* heŕe taking the place of *[para](para.md)*. Yet it would be more reasonable to explain the word as para apara (upara?) \+ ya, i.e. that which belongs to this world & the beyond, or everything that comes within the range of the faculties. Cp.; *[parovara](parovara.md)*.
