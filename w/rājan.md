Rājā (Rājan)

king, a ruling potentate. The defn at Vin.iii.222 is “yo koci rajjaṃ kāreti.” The fanciful etym. at DN.iii.93 Vism.419 is “dhammena pare rañjetī ti rājā” i.e. he gladdens others with his righteousness  
■ At the latter passage the origin of kingly government is given as the third stage in the constitution of a people, the 2 preceding being *mahā\-sammata* (general consent) and *[khattiya](khattiya.md)* (the land\-aristocrats)

 § 92#1.

1. rājā is a term of sovereignship. The term rājā as used in Buddhist India does not admit of a uniform interpretation and translation. It is primarily an appellative (or title) of a *[khattiya](khattiya.md)*, and often the two are used promiscuously. Besides, it has a far wider sphere of meaning than we convey by any translation like “king” or even “sovereign,” or “prince.” We find it used as a designation of “king” in the sense of an elected or successory (crowned) *monarch*, but also in the meaning of a distinguished *nobleman*, or a local *chieftain*, or a *prince* with var. attributes characterizing his position according to special functions. From this we get the foll. scheme:
   1. [rājā](rājā.md)* never takes the place of deva in the meaning king, but that *[mahārāja](mahārāja.md)* is used in voc equivalent to *[deva](deva.md)* ] a world\-king, over\-lord, a so\-called *cakkavatti rājā*. This is an office (as “Universal King”) peculiar to the *Mahāpurisa* or the (mythol. “Great Man,” who may become either the Saviour of men in the religious sense, a Sammā\-sambuddha, or a just Ruler of the earth in the worldly sense, a King of Righteousness. These are the 2 gatis of such a being as described at var. places of the Canon (e.g. Snp.p.106; Snp.1002, Snp.1003; DN.iii.142; AN.i.76). His power is absolute, and is described in the standard phrase “c dhammiko *dhamma\-rājā* cāturanto vijitāvī janapadatthāvariya\-ppatto satta\-ratana\-samannāgato,” e.g. DN.iii.59. Dhammapāla gives the dignity of a C. as the first “human sovereign powers” (Pv\-a.117). The four *iddhi’s* of a C. are given (quite crudely) at MN.iii.176: he is beautiful, lives longer than others, is of a healthier constitution than others, he is beloved by the brahmins and householders. Other qualities: how his remains should be treated = DN.ii.141; deserves a thūpa DN.ii.142 sq.; his four qualities DN.ii.145 (the 4 assemblies of khattiyas, brāhmaṇas, gahapatis samaṇas are pleased with him). See under cakkavatti & ratana  
      ■ In a similar sense the term; *dhamma\-rājā* is used as epithet of the Buddha Snp.554 (rāj’ âham asmi dh\-.r. anuttaro); Ja.i.262; and a reflection of the higher sphere is seen in the title of politeness (only used in *voc.*) *[mahārāja](mahārāja.md)*, e.g. Snp.416 (addressed to Bimbisāra Pv\-a.22 (id.); Ja.vi.515
   2. [in a larger constitutional state] the crowned (muddhâvasitta) monarch (i.e. khattiya) as the head of the principality or kingdom The defn of this (general) rājā at Cnd.542 is significant of the idea of a king prevalent in early Buddhist times It is: “khattiyo muddh’ âbhisitto vijita\-sangāmo nihata\-paccāmitto laddh’ adhippāyo paripuṇṇa\-koṭthāgāro,” i.e. “a crowned noble, victorious in battle slaying his foes, fulfilling his desires, having his storehouses full.” This king is “the top of men” (mukhaṃ manussānaṃ) Vin.i.246 = Snp.568. Cp. DN.i.7; Snp.46 (raṭṭhaṃ vijitam pahāya); Ja.v.448 and passim. See also below 3, 4 & 6  
      ■ In similes: see J.P.T.S. 1907 128; & cp. Vism.152 (r. va saddh’ antagato), Vism.336 (wishing to become an artisan). Here belongs the title of the king of the devas (Sakka) “*deva\-rājā*,” e.g. Dhp\-a.iii.269, Dhp\-a.iii.441; Pv\-a.62
   3. (in an oligarchic sense) member of a kula of khattiyas, e.g. the kumāras of the Sakiyans and Koliyans are all called rājāno of the rājakulānaṃ in Ja.v.413 sq., or at least the heads of those kulas. Cp. *B. Ind.* p. 19
   4. (in a smaller, autocratic state) a chieftain, prince, ruler; usually (collectively as a *group:* *rājāno*, thus indicating their lesser importance e.g. AN.v.22 (kuḍḍa\-rājāno rañño cakkavattissa anuyuttā bhavanti: so read for anuyantā); Snp.553 (bhoja˚ similar to rāja\-bhoggā or bhogiyā as given at Snp\-a.453); AN.ii.74 sq. (dhammikā & a˚); Ja.iv.495 Similarly at Vin.i.228 we find the division into the 3 ranks: mahesakkhā rājāno, majjhimā r., nīcā r. Here also belongs the designation of the 4 *lokapālā* (or Guardians of the World) at cattāro *mahā\-rājāno*, the mahā˚ being added for sake of politeness (cp. Note A on *[mahā](mahā.md)*), e.g. AN.iv.242. See also paṭirājā & cp. below 4 c
   5. A wider range of meaning is attached to several sub\-divisions (with rājā or without): officials and men who occasionally take the place of the king (royal functionaries), but are by public opinion considered almost equal to the king. Here belongs the defn of what is termed “*rājāno*” (pl. like d) at Vin.iii.47, viz. rājā, padesa\-rājā, maṇḍalikā, antarabhogikā akkhadassā, mahāmattā, *ye vā pana chejjabhejjaṃ anusāsanti* (i.e. those who have juridical power). See also below 4 b, and ˚putta, ˚bhogga [other compounds].

2. It would fill a separate book, if we were to give a full monograph of kingship in and after the Buddha’s time; we therefore content ourselves with a few principal remarks. The office of king was hereditary: kula\-santakaṃ rajjaṃ Ja.i.395; Ja.ii.116; Ja.iv.124 but we sometimes read of a king being elected with great pomp: Ja.i.470; Pv\-a.74. He had the political and military power in his hand, also the jurisdiction although in this he is often represented by the *[mahāmatta](mahāmatta.md)*, the *active* head of the state. His 10 duties are mentioned at several places (see below under ˚dhammā) Others are mentioned e.g. at DN.i.135, where it is said he gives food and seed\-corn to the farmer, capital to the trader, wages to the people in government service. His qualifications are 8 fold (see DN.i.137): well\-born (“gentleman,” khattiya), handsome, wealthy, powerful (with his army), a believer, learned, clever, intelligent. His wealth is proverbial and is characterized in a stock phrase, which is also used of other ranks, like seṭṭhi’s & brāhmaṇa’s, viz. “aḍḍha mahaddhana mahābhoga pahūta\-jātarūpa\-rajata pahūta\-vitt’ ûpakaraṇa pahūtadhana\-dhañña paripuṇṇa\-kosa\-koṭṭhāgāra,” e.g. DN.i.134. For a late description of a king’s quality and distinction see Mil.226, Mil.227  
   ■ His disciplinary authority is emphasized; he spares no tortures in punishing adversaries or malefactors, esp. the *[cora](cora.md)* (see below 4 c). A summary example of these punishments inflicted on criminals is the long passage illustrating *[dukkha](dukkha.md)* (bodily pain) at Cnd.304#iii cp. MN.iii.163 (here also on a *[cora](cora.md)*).
3. The king (rājā or khattiya) in the popular opinion, as reflected in language, heads several lists, which have often been taken as enumerating “castes,” but which are simply inclusive statements of var. prominent ranks as playing a rôle in the social life of the state, and which were formulated according to diff. occasions. Thus some show a more political, some a more religious aspect. e.g. *khattiya* amacca brāhmaṇa gahapati DN.i.136; *rājā* brāhmaṇa gahapatika AN.i.68, where another formula has *khattiya* br. g. AN.i.66; Ja.i.217; and the foll. with an intermediate “rank” (something like “royalty, “the royal household”) between the king and the brahmins: rājā *rājaputtā* brāhmaṇā gahapatikā negama\-jānapadā AN.ii.74 sq.; rājāno *rāja\-mahāmattā khattiyā* br., gah., titthiyā DN.iii.44 (translation *Dialogues* too weak “rājas & their officials”); rājā *rājabhogga* br. gah. Vin.iii.221.
4. Var. aspects illustrating the position of the king in relation to other prominent groups of the court or populace:
   1. *rājā & khattiya;* All kings *were* khattiyas. The kh. is a noble κα ̓τἐςοξήν (cp. Gr. ἡγεμών) as seen fr. defn *jāti\-khattiya* at Snp\-a.453 and var. contexts. Already in the Rig Veda the kṣatriya is a person belonging to a *royal* family (RV x.109, 3), and *rājanya* is an epithet of kṣatriya (see Zimmer *Altindisches Leben* 213)  
      ■ *rājā khattiyo* muddhâvassito “a crowned king” DN.i.69; DN.iii.61 sq.; Vin.iv.160; AN.i.106 sq.; AN.ii.207 (contrasted with brāhmaṇa mahāsāla); AN.iii.299 (if lazy, he is not liked by the people) MN.iii.172 sq. (how he becomes a cakkavatti through the appearance of the cakka\-ratana)  
      ■ Without *[muddhāvasitta](muddhāvasitta.md)*: rājāno khattiyā Dhp.294 = Ne.165. Cp khattiyā bhoja\-rājāno the khattiyas, the (noble or lesser?) kings (as followers of the cakkavatti) Snp.553 (see *[bhoja](bhoja.md)*). At Ja.vi.515. *rājāno* corresponds directly to *[khattiyā](khattiyā.md)* on p. 517 (saṭṭhisahassa˚); cp. expression khattiya\-kula Ja.i.217 as equivalent to rāja\-kula
   2. *rājā & mahāmatta*. The latter occupies the position of “Premier,” but is a rank equal to the king hence often called *[rājā](rājā.md)* himself: Vin.iii.47 where styled “akkhadassa mahāmatta.” Otherwise he is always termed *rāja\-mahāmatta* “royal minister,” or “H.R.H the Premier,” e.g. Vin.i.172; AN.i.279; Vin.i.228 (see [as Magadha\-mahāmatta](as Magadha\-mahāmatta.md)), and called himself a *khattiya* DN.iii.44
   3. *rājā & cora*. A prominent figure in the affairs of State is the “robber\-chief” (mahā\-cora) The contrast\-pair *rajāno* (so always pl.) & *[cora](cora.md)* is very frequent, and in this connection we have to think of rājāno as either smaller kings, knights or royals (royalists), i.e. officers of the kings or “the king’s Guards. Thus at Ja.iii.34 the C. expln as *rāja\-purisā*. It is here used as a term of warning or frightening “get up robber, so that the kings (alias ʻpoliceman’) won’t catch you”: uṭṭhehi cora mā taṃ gahesuṃ *rājāno* Other passages are e.g. : DN.i.7 (rāja\-kathā & corakathā) = Vin.i.188; MN.iii.163 (rājāno coraṃ āgucāriṃ gahetvā); AN.i.68, AN.i.154; Iti.89 (rāj’ âbhinīta \+ cor˚); in sequence; *rājāno corā dhuttā* (as being dangerous to the bhikkhus) at Vin.i.150, Vin.i.161.

These are referred to as *dasa rājadhammā* at Ja.i.260 Ja.i.399 Ja.ii.400; Ja.iii.320; Ja.v.119, Ja.v.378; usually in phrase “dasa rāja\-dhamme akopetvā dhammena rajjan kāresi” he ruled in righteousness, not shaking the tenfold code of the king. Another set of 3 are mentioned at Ja.v.112 viz. “vitathaṁ kodhaṁ hāsaṁ nivāraye” (explained as giving up musāvāda, kodha & adhamma\-hāsa)

  1. royal, in the service of the king, in foll. phrases: rāja\-bhoggaṃ raññā dinnaṃ rāja\-dāyaṃ brahma\-deyyaṃ DN.i.87, of a flourishing place. *Dial.* i.108 trsls “with power over it as if he were king,” and explains with: “where the king has proprietary rights.” The C. rather unmeaningly explains as “rāja\-laddha” (DN\-a.i.245). The BSk. has a curious version of this phrase: “rājñā\-*agni\-* dattena brahmadeyyaṃ dattaṃ” (given by the king in the place of agni?) Divy.620  
     ■ Further at Vin.iii.221 in sequence rājā r\-bhogga, brāhmaṇa, gahapatika where the C. explains (on p. 222) as “yo koci rañño bhatta\-vetan’ āhāro.” (We should be inclined to take this as No. 2.). Thirdly, in stock phrase “rājâraha rājabhogga rañño angan t’ eva sankhaṃ gacchati,” i.e. worthy of a king, imperial, he justifies the royal qualification said of a thoroughbred horse at AN.i.244 AN.ii.113; of a soldier (yodh’ ājīva) at AN.i.284; of an elephant at Ja.ii.370 (where it is explained as “rāja paribhoga”) Also as “royal possessions” in general at Dhp\-a.i.312 Dhp\-a.i.13  
     ■ Fick, *Soc. Gl.* 99 does not help much, he takes it as “king’s official.”
  2. royal, of royal power, one entitled to the throne. Either as bhogga, bhogiya (Snp\-a.453) or (khattiyā) *bhoja\-rājāno* (Snp.553). Thus at Vin.iii.221, where it takes the place of the usual khattiya “royal noble” & Snp.553, where it is combd (as bhoja rājano) *with* khattiyā.
