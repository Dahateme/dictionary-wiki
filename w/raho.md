Rahas & Raho

neuter lonely place, solitude, loneliness; secrecy, privacy.

1. *[raho](raho.md)*: occurring only as *adv.* “secretly, lonely, in secret,” either *absolutely*, e.g. SN.i.46; Snp.388; Pv.ii.7#16 (opp. āvi openly); Pv.iv.1#40 (raho nisinna); Vism.201 (na raho karoti pāpāni arahaṃ tena vuccati); or in *compounds* e.g. *\-gata* being in private, being alone DN.i.134 (\+ paṭisallīna); Snp.p.60 See also under paṭisallīna; *\-gama* “secret convention secret intercourse,” fig. a secret adviser Ja.vi.369 (after Kern, not found!); *\-vāda* secret talk MN.iii.230. See also *anu˚*.
2. *rahā˚*; only in cpd. *rahā\-bhāva* secrecy in defn of arahant at DN\-a.i.146 = Vism.201 (rahābhāvena ten’ esa arahan ti). See also der. *rāha\-seyyaka*. *Note.* Hardy’s reading *yathā rahaṃ* at Pv.ii.9#23 & Pv\-a.78 is not correct, it should be yath’ ârahaṃ (cp. similarly pūj\-âraha). In the same sense we would preferably read agg’ āsan’ ādi\-arahānaṃ “of those who merit the first seat etc.” at Ja.i.217, although all MSS. have aggāsanādi\-rahānaṃ, thus postulating a form *raha = araha*.

Vedic rahas. The Pāli word is restricted to the forms *[raho](raho.md)* and *rahā˚*; (= \*rahaḥ); a loc. *rahasi* is mentioned by Childers, but not found in the Canon
