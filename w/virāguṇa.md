in meaning “fading away, waning” in verse at Iti.69 (of viññāṇa) is doubtful reading. It corresponds to virāgadhamma of the prose part (virāgudh˚ vv.ll.) The variant reading is *pabhaṅguṇa* (which might be preferable unless we regard it as an explanation of *[virāgin](virāgin.md)*, if we should write it thus).
