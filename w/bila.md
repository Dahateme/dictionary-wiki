Bila1

neuter a hole, den, cave AN.ii.33 = SN.iii.85; Thag.189 Mnd.362; Ja.i.480; Ja.ii.53; Ja.vi.574 (= guhā C.); Mil.151 Sdhp.23  
■ *kaṇṇa˚*; orifice of the ear Vism.195; *vammīka˚*; ant’s nest Ja.iv.30; *sota˚*; = kaṇṇa˚ Dhs\-a.310.

* *\-[āsaya](āsaya.md)* (adj.) living in holes, a cave\-dweller, one of the four classes of animals (bil˚, dak˚, van˚, rukkh˚ SN.iii.85 = AN.ii.33; Mnd.362; Bv.ii.97; Ja.i.18.

Vedic bila, perhaps fr. *bhid* to break, cp. *K.Z.* 12, 123. Thus already explained by Dhtp.489: bila bhedane

Bila2

neuter a part, bit Ja.vi.153 (˚sataṃ 100 pieces); abl. *[bilaso](bilaso.md)* (adv.) bit by bit MN.i.58 = MN.iii.91 (variant reading vilaso). At Ja.v.90 in cpd. *migābilaṃ* (maṃsaṃ it is doubtful whether we should read mig’ābilaṃ (thus as we have done, taking ābila = āvila), or migā\-bilaṃ with a lengthened metri causâ, as the C. seems to take it (migehi khādita\-maṃsato atirittaṃ *koṭṭhāsaṃ*).

* *\-[kata](kata.md)* cut into pieces, made into bits Ja.v.266 (read macchā bilakatā yathā for macchābhīlā katā y.). The C. here (p. 272) explains as *koṭṭhāsa*\-kata; at Ja.vi.111 however the same phrase is interpreted as *puñja*\-kata i.e. thrown into a heap (like fish caught by a fisherman in nets). Both passages are applied to fish and refer to tortures in Niraya.
