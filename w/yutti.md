“fitting,” i.e.

1. application, use Mil.3 (opamma˚).
2. fitness vāda˚, Kv\-a.37; in instr. *yuttiyā* in accordance with Mhvs.10, Mhvs.66 (vacana˚); Sdhp.340 (sutti˚); and abl *[yuttito](yuttito.md)* Sdhp.505.
3. (logical) fitness, right construction, correctness of meaning; one of the 16 categories (hārā), applied to the exposition of texts, enumerated in the 1st section of the Netti; e.g. at Ne.1–Ne.3, Ne.103; Kp\-a.18; Snp\-a.551, Snp\-a.552. Thus abl. *[yuttito](yuttito.md)* by way of correctness or fitness (contrasted to *suttato*) Vb\-a.173 = Vism.562; and *yutti\-vasena* by means of correctness (of meaning) Snp\-a.103 (contrasted to *[anussava](anussava.md)*).
4. trick device, practice Ja.vi.215.

* *\-[kata](kata.md)* combined with; (nt.) union, alloy Vv\-a.13.
