### I. *Metaphorical meaning* ###

1. In the first place 10 is used for measurement (more recent & comprehensive than its base 5); it is the no. of a set or comprehensive unity, not in a vague (like 3 or 5), but in a definite sense.
2. There inheres in it the idea of a fixed measure, with which that of an authoritative, solemn & auspicious importance is coupled. This applies to the unit as well as its decimal combinations (100, 1000) Ethically it denotes a circle, to fulfil all of which constitutes a high achievement or power.
