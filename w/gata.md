gone, in all meanings of gacchati (q.v.) viz.

1. literal. gone away, arrived at, directed to (c. acc.), opp ṭhita: gate ṭhite nisinne (loc. abs.) when going standing, sitting down (cp. gacchati 1) DN.i.70; opp āgata: yassa maggaṃ na jānāsi āgatassa gatassa vā Snp.582 (cp. gati 2). Also periphrastic (= gacchati 5 b) aṭṭhi paritvā gataṃ “the bone fell down” Ja.iii.26 Very often gata stands in the sense of a finite verb (= aor. gacchi or agamāsi): yo ca Buddhaṃ… saraṇaṃ gato (cp. gacchati 4) Dhp.190; attano vasanaṭṭhānaṃ gato he went to his domicile Ja.i.280; Ja.ii.160; nāvā Aggimālaṃ gatā the ship went to Aggimālā Ja.iv.139.
2. in applied meaning: gone in a certain way, i.e. affected, behaved, fared, fated, being in or having come into a state or condition. So in sugata & duggata (see below) and as second part of compounds in gen., viz.; *gone;* atthaṃ˚ gone home, set; addha˚ done with the journey (cp. gat\-addhin); *gone into:* taṇhā˚ fallen a victim to thirst, tama˚ obscured, raho˚, secluded, vyasana˚ fallen into misery; *having reached:* anta˚ arrived at the goal (in this sense often combined with patta: antagata antapatta Cnd.436, Cnd.612), koṭi˚ perfected, parinibbāna having ceased to exist. vijjā˚ having attained (right knowledge; *connected with, referring to, concerning:* kāya˚ relating to the body (kāyagatā sati, e.g. Vism.111, Vism.197, Vism.240 sq.); diṭṭhi˚ being of a (wrong) view sankhāra˚, etc  
   ■ Sometimes gata is replaced by kata and vice versa: anabhāvaṃkata → anabhāvaṃ gacchati kālagata → kālakata (q.v.).  
   ■ *agata* not gone to, not frequented: ˚ṃ disaṃ (of Nibbāna) Dhp.323; purisantaraṃ ˚ṃ mātugāmaṃ “a maid who has not been with a man” Ja.i.290.
