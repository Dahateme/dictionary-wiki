explained by Buddhaghosa DN\-a.i.247 as “the science which assists the officiating priests by laying down rules for the rites, or by leaving them to their discretion” (so Trenckner, *J.P.T.S.* 1908, 116) In short, the ritual; the kalpa as it is called as one of the vedangas. Only in a stock list of the subject a learned Brahmin is supposed to have mastered DN.i.88; AN.i.163, AN.i.166; Snp.1020; Mil.10, Mil.178. So in BSk; Avs.ii.19; Divy.619.
