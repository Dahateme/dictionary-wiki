intention, purpose, mind (as active force), mental action. Almost equivalent to mano Dhs § 6. In later language mānasa is quite synonymous with hadaya. The word, used absolutely, is more a t. t. in philosophy than a living part of the language. It is more frequent as \-˚ in adj use, where its connection with *[mano](mano.md)* is still more felt. Its absolute use probably originated from the latter use.  
■ Dhs\-a.140 (= mano); Vb.144 sq. (in definition of viññāṇa as cittaṃ, mano, mānasaṃ, hadayaṃ etc. see *[mano](mano.md)* ii.3); Dhp\-a.ii.12 (paradāre mānasaṃ na bandhissāmi “shall have no intention towards another’s wife,” i.e. shall not desire another’s wife); Mhvs.4, Mhvs.6 (sabbesaṃ hita\-mānasā with the intention of common welfare); Mhvs.32, Mhvs.56 (rañño hāsesi mānasaṃ gladdened the heart of the king)  
■ As adj. (\-˚): being of such & such a mind, having a… mind, with a… heart; like *ādīna˚* with his mind in danger SN.v.74 (\+ apatiṭṭhitacitta); *uggata˚* lofty\-minded Vv\-a.217; *pasanna˚* with settled (peaceful) mind Snp.402 and frequently; *mūḷha˚* infatuated Mhvs.5, Mhvs.239; *rata˚*; Pv\-a.19; *sañcodita˚* urged (in her heart) Pv\-a.68; *soka\-santatta˚* with a heart burning with grief Pv\-a.38.
