1. (cp. vediyati & vedanā) (joyful) feeling, religious feeling, enthusiasm awe, emotion, excitement (something like; *[saṃvega](saṃvega.md)*) DN.ii.210 (˚paṭilābha \+ somanassa\-paṭilābha) MN.i.465 (uḷāra); Snp.1027 (= pīti Snp\-a.585); Ja.ii.336 Ja.iii.266. *attha\-veda \+ dhamma\-veda* enthusiasm for the truth (for the letter & the spirit) of Buddha’s teaching MN.i.37; AN.v.329 sq., AN.v.333, AN.v.349, AN.v.352; *[veda](veda.md)* here interpreted as “somanassaṃ” at MN\-a.i.173  
   ■ See also cpd *\-jāta*.
2. (cp. vedeti & vijjā) (higher) knowledge (as “Buddhist” antithesis to the authority of the “Veda”) insight, revelation, wisdom: that which Bdhgh at MN\-a.i.173 defines with “*[ñāṇa](ñāṇa.md)*,” and illustrates with *[vedagū](vedagū.md)* of Snp.1059; or refers to at DN\-a.i.139 with defn “vidanti etenā ti vedo.” Thus at Snp.529 & Snp.792 (= vedā vuccanti catūsu maggesu ñāṇaṃ paññā Mnd.93), cp. Snp\-a.403  
   ■ As adj. *[veda](veda.md)* epithet of the Buddha “the knower or the possessor of revelation, at MN.i.386. See also *[vedagū](vedagū.md)*.
3. the Veda(s), the *brahmanic* canon of authorized religious teaching (revelation) & practice otherwise given as “*[gantha](gantha.md)*” i.e. “text” at MN\-a.i.173 & illustrated with “tiṇṇaṃ vedānaṃ pāragū.” The latter formula is frequent in stock phrase describing the accomplishments of a Brahmin, e.g. at DN.i.88; MN.ii.133; Snp.1019; AN.i.163; Dhp\-a.iii.361. In the older texts only the 3 Vedas (irubbeda = Rg; yaju˚ & sāma˚) are referred to, whereas later (in the Commentaries) we find the 4 mentioned (athabbana added), e.g. the; *three* at SN.iv.118; Ja.i.168; Ja.ii.47; Ja.iii.537; Mil.10; Vism.384; the *four* at DN\-a.i.247; Mil.178  
   ■ Unspecified (sg.): Snp\-a.462 As adj. *[veda](veda.md)* “knowing the Vedas” Snp\-a.463 (ti˚), cp *[tevijja](tevijja.md)*  
   ■ The *Vedas* in this connection are not often mentioned, they are almost identical with the *Mantras* (see *[manta](manta.md)*) and are often (in Com.) mentioned either jointly with *[manta](manta.md)* or promiscuously, e.g. Pv.ii.6#13 (the Vedas with the 6 *aṅgas*, i.e. vedāngas, called *[manta](manta.md)*); Snp\-a.293 (manta\-pāragū \+ veda\-pāragū), Snp\-a.322, Snp\-a.448.

*\-antagu* “one who has reached the end of knowledge, i.e. one who has obtained perfection in wisdom Vin.i.3; Snp.463. *\-[gū](gū.md)* one who has attained to highest knowledge (said of the Buddha). Thus different from “tiṇṇaṃ vedānaṃ *[pāragū](pāragū.md)*,” which is brahmanic. The expln of vedagū is “catūsu maggesu ñāṇaṃ” Cnd.612 & see above 2  
■ SN.i.141, SN.i.168; SN.iv.83, SN.iv.206; AN.ii.6; AN.iv.340; Snp.322, Snp.458, Snp.529, Snp.749, Snp.846, Snp.947, Snp.1049, Snp.1060; Mnd.93 Mnd.204, Mnd.299, Mnd.431. A peculiar meaning of *[vedagū](vedagū.md)* is that of “soul” (lit. attainer of wisdom) at Mil.54 & Mil.71; *\-[jāta](jāta.md)* thrilled, filled with enthusiasm, overcome with awe, excited AN.ii.63; Snp.995, Snp.1023; Kv.554 = Vv.34#27 (= jāta\-somanassa Vv\-a.156); Ja.i.11; Mil.297. *\-[pāragū](pāragū.md)* one who excels in the knowledge of the Vedas, perfected in the Veda Snp\-a.293; cp. above 3. *\-[bandhu](bandhu.md)* one who is familiar with the Vedas Snp\-a.192.
