1. configuration, position; composition, nature, shape, form Vin.ii.76; MN.i.120 (spelt ˚nth˚); AN.i.50; AN.iv.190 (C. osakkana); Mil.270 Mil.316, Mil.405; Ja.i.71, Ja.i.291, Ja.i.368; Ja.ii.108; Vism.184, Vism.225, Vism.243; Dhs\-a.321; DN\-a.i.88 (nth); Snp\-a.464 (= linga). *su˚*; well formed Snp.28  
   ■ adj. (\-˚) having the appearance of *megha\-vaṇṇa˚*; Pv\-a.251; *chavi˚*; appearance of the skin Ja.i.489; *vaṇṇa˚*; outward semblance Ne.27; Ja.i.271 *sarīra˚*; the (material) body Vism.193.
2. fuel Ja.ii.330 = Ja.iv.471.
3. (usually spelt ˚nth˚) a resting place, meeting place, public place (market) (cp. Sk. sansthāna in this meaning). At SN.i.201 in phrase *nadī\-tīresu saṇṭhāne sabhāsu rathiyāsu* (i.e. at all public places) SN.i.201 reads *saṇṭhāne* (variant reading santhāne); cp. *K.S.* i.256 from C.: “a resting place (vissamana\-ṭṭhāne) near the city gate, when market\-wares had been brought down, translation “resting by the gates.” This stanza is quoted at Snp\-a.20, where the ed. prefers reading *panthāne* as correct reading (variant reading saṇṭhāne). At MN.i.481 (˚nth˚) SN.ii.28 (2 fr. b.), it seems to be used in the sense of “end stopping, cessation” = AN.iv.190 (the editions of S and A have saṇṭhāna). At Ja.vi.113 it is translated by “market place,” the comp. *saṇṭhāna\-gata* being explained by the Comm. by saṇṭhāna\-mariyādaṃ gatā, but at Ja.vi.360 *saṇṭhāna\-gata* is by the English translator translated “a wealthy man” (*vinicchaye ṭhito*, Com.), which however, ought to be “in the court house” (cp. vinicchaya\-ṭṭhāna), i.e. publicly. In both places there is also variant reading santhāna\-˚.
