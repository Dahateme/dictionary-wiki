certain measure of capacity (esp. of grain, see below khārika). It is used of the eight requisites of an ascetic, and often in conn. with his yoke (kāja): “a khārī\-load.”

* *\-[kāja](kāja.md)* Vin.i.33 (cp. *Vin Texts* i.132); Ja.v.204.
* *\-[bhaṇḍa](bhaṇḍa.md)* Dhp\-a.iii.243 (:kahaṃ te kh\-bh˚ ko pabbajita parikkhāro)

* *\-[vidha](vidha.md)* = ˚kāja SN.i.78 = Ud.65; DN.i.101. At Ud and D passages it is read vividha, but DN\-a.i.269 makes it clear: khārī ti araṇi\-kamaṇḍalu\-sūcâdayo tāpasa\-parikkhārā; vidho ti kāco, tasmā khāribharitaṃ kācam ādāyā ti attho As Kern (

* *\-vidha* is a distortion of *[vivadha](vivadha.md)*, which is synonymous with *[kāja](kāja.md)*.
