```

at Thig.447 T (reading of C. is abhi˚) is explained Thag\-a.271 to mean apakiritvā chaḍḍetvā throwing away, slighting, offending. The correct etym = Sk. avakirati (ava \+ *kṛ2* to strew, cast out) in sense “to cast off, reject”, to which also belongs kirāta in meaning “cast off” i.e. man of a so\-called low tribe. See also avakirati 2.
