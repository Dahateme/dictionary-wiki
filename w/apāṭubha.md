summary = "adjective = apāṭuka, i.e. sly, fraudulent Ja.iv.18"
```

adjective = apāṭuka, i.e. sly, fraudulent Ja.iv.184 (in context with nekatika; C. explains apāṭubhāva dhanuppāda\-virahita, in which latter virahita does not fit in; the pass. seems corrupt).

a \+ pātu \+ bha (?), at the only passage changed by Morris J.P.T.S. 1893, 7 to apāṭuka but without reason
