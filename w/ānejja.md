and *[Ānañja](Ānañja.md)* immovability, imperturbability, impassibility. The word is *n.* but occurs as *adj.* at Vin.iii.109 (ānañja samādhi, with which cp. BSk. ānijyā śāntiḥ at Avs.i.199  
■ The term usually occurs in cpd ānejja\-ppatta (adj.) immovable lit. having attained impassibility expld. by Bdhgh. at Vin.iii.267 (on Pār. Vin.i.1, 6 as *acala, niccala*, i.e. motionless. This cpd. is indicated below by (p.) after the reference  
■ The various spellings of the word are as follows:

1. *ānejja* DN.i.76 (variant reading ānañja\-p.) AN.ii.184 (p.); AN.iii.93 (p.), AN.iii.100 (p.), AN.iii.377 sq. (p.); Cnd.471 (variant reading aneja, ānañja) = Vb.137 (āneñja) Cnd.569#a (variant reading ānañja), 601 (variant reading anejja & aneñja); Pp.60 (p.); DN\-a.i.219 (variant reading BB āneñja).
2. *ānañja* Vin.iii.4 (p.) (variant reading ānañca˚, anañja˚, ānañja˚; Bdhgh. ānejja p. 267), Vin.iii.109; Ud.27 (samādhi, adj. variant reading ānañca); Dhp\-a.iv.46. See also below cpd. ˚kāraṇa  
   ■ A peculiarity of Trenckner a spelling is *āṇañja* at MN.ii.229 (variant reading aṇañja aneñja, āneñja), MN.ii.253, MN.ii.254.
3. *[āneñja](āneñja.md)* SN.ii.82. (variant reading āṇañje, or is it āṇeñja?); DN.iii.217 (˚âbhisankhāra of imperturbable character, remaining static, cp. *Kvu trsl.* 358); Mnd.90 (id.), Mnd.206, Mnd.442; Pts.ii.206; Vb.135, Vb.340 Vism.377 (p.), Vism.386 (sixteen˚ fold), Vism.571; Ne.87, Ne.99. See also iñjati.

* *\-[kāraṇa](kāraṇa.md)* trick of immovability, i.e. pretending to be dead (done by an elephant, but see differently Morris *J P T S.* 1886, 154) Ja.i.415; Ja.ii.325 (variant reading āṇañja, āneñca ānañca); Ja.iv.308; Ja.v.273, Ja.v.310.

abstr. fr. an \+ \*añja or \*ejja = \*ijja. The Sanskritised equivalent would be \*iñjya or \*iñgya of *iṅg* to stir, move, with a peculiar substitution of *\*aṅg* in Pāli, referring it to a base with ṛ (probably Sk. *ṛj* ṛñjati) in analogy to a form like Sk. ṛṇa = Pāli aṇa iṇa, both a & i representing Sk. ṛ. The form; *[añja](añja.md)* would thus correspond to a Sk. \*añjya (\*añgya). The third P form *ān\-eñja* is a direct (later, and probably re\-instituted formation from Sk. iñjya, which in an interesting way became in BSk. re\-sanskritised to *āñijya* (which on the other hand may represent āñejja & thus give the latter the feature of a later, but more specifically Pāli form) The editions of P. Texts show a great variance of spelling based on MSS. vacillation, in part also due to confusion of derivation
