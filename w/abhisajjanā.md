at Snp.49 evidently means “scolding, cursing, being in bad temper” (cp. abhisajjati), as its combn. with vāc’ âbhilāpa indicates, but is expld. both by Nd ii.& Bdhgh. as “sticking to, cleaving, craving, desire” (= taṇhā), after the meaning of abhisanga. See Cnd.89 & Cnd.107; Snp\-a.98 (sineha\-vasena) cp. also the compromise\-expln by Bdhgh. of abhisajjati as kodha\-vasena *[laggati](laggati.md)* (DN\-a.i.257).

abstr. fr. abhisajjati, cp. abhisajjana
