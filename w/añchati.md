stretches; pulls, drags, turns (on a lathe).

``` toml

summary = "to pull, drag, pull along to turn on a lathe DN.ii"
```

to pull, drag, pull along to turn on a lathe DN.ii.291 (bhamakāro dīghaṃ a., where K has note: añjanto ti pi acchanto ti pi pātho) = MN.i.56 (vv.ll. MN.i.532 acch˚ & añj˚); Thag.750 (añcāmi T., v.l aññāmi). Añchati should also be read at Ja.i.417 for *udakaṃ añcanti* (in expln. of udañcanī pulling the water up from a well, q.v.), where it corresponds to *udakaṃ ākkaḍḍhati* in the same sentence.

in meaning = ākaḍḍhati, which latter is also the Sk. gloss (ākārṣayati) to the Jain Prk. aṃchāvei = añchati see Morris, J. P. T. S. 1893, 60
