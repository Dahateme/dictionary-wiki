at Ja.iii.120 is an old misreading & is to be corrected into; *nipatāmase* (= let us gather, bring together = dedicate), unless it be read as *nipphadāmase* (= do, set forth, prepare, give), in spite of Com. expln p. 121: nikārapakārā (= nipaccakārā?) upasaggā (upasajja?) dāmase (*dā*) ti attho; endorsed by Müller, *P.G.* p. 97 & Kern,
» Toevoegselen

 p.175. It cannot be ni \+ pa dāmase, since ni is *never* used as secondary (modifying verb\-component (see *ni*˚ A 2), & Bdhgh’s expln is popular etym. Cp. nipatāmase at Ja.iv.361 (see *[nipatati](nipatati.md)*).
