doubtful word occurring only in one stock phrase, viz. “ubhato\-mukhā m. pūrā nānā\-vihitassa dhaññassa” at MN.i.57 (vv.ll. putoḷi, mūṭolī) = MN.iii.90 (mūtoḷī) = DN.ii.293 (T. mutoli, variant reading muṭoli; gloss K pūtolī). The *Dial.* ii.330 trsl. “sample bag” (see note on this passage; with remark “spelling uncertain”) Neumann, *Mittlere Sammlung* i.101 trsls “Sack.” Kern,

 s. v. mutoḷī tries to connect it with BSk *[moṭa](moṭa.md)* (Hindi moṭh), bundle, which (with vv.ll. mūḍha muṭa, mūṭa) occurs only in one stock phrase “bharaiḥ motaiḥ piṭakaiḥ” at Divy.5, Divy.332, Divy.501, Divy.524. The more likely solution, however, is that *[mutoḷī](mutoḷī.md)* is a distortion of *puṭosā* (puṭosa), which is found as variant reading to *[puṭaṃsa](puṭaṃsa.md)* at all passages concerned (see puṭaṃsa). Thus the meaning is “bag, provision\-bag.” The BSk. *[moṭa](moṭa.md)* (muṭa) remains to be elucidated. The same meaning “provision\-bag” fits at Vism.328 in cpd. *yāna˚*; where spelling is T. ˚paṭṭoli, variant reading BB ˚putoḷi, but which is clearly identical with our term. We should thus prefer to read *yāna\-puṭosi* “carriage\-bag for provisions.”
