1. in phrase *\-piṅgala* (with) disgustingly red (eyes) (perhaps = nibbiṇṇa?) Ja.v.42 (of a giant).
2. with ref. to a road: broken up, i.e. much frequented, busy street Ja.vi.276 (of vīthi, bazaar, in contrast with a\-nibbiddha\-raccha carriage\-road, which is not a thoroughfare. The reading patatthiyo *at* Ja.vi.276, for which nibbiddha\-vīthiyo is the C. expln is to be corrected into pathaddhiyo).

pp. of nibbijjhati
