*Note.* The ceremony of admission to the priesthood is called *[pabbajjā](pabbajjā.md)* (or pabbajana), if viewed as the act of the candidate of orders, and *[pabbājana](pabbājana.md)* (q.v.) if viewed as the act of the priest conferring orders; the latter term however does not occur in this meaning in the Canon.
