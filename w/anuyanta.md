following; a follower, a vassal

at AN.v.22 is doubtful reading (variant reading *[anuyutta](anuyutta.md)*). The meaning is either “inferior to, dependent on, a subject of, a vassal” or “attending on”. The explanation may compare Sk. anuyātaṃ attendance, in which latter case anu\-yantṛ would be “an inferior ruler” and P. yanta would represent the n. a.g. yantā as a\-stem. The variant reading is perhaps preferable as long as other passages with anuyanta are not found (see *[anuyutta](anuyutta.md)* 2).

anu \+ *[yā](yā.md)*, cp. anuyāyin or Sk. yantṛ ruler [ *yam*
