in the pass. at Dhs.14 = Cnd.628 is evidently meant to be taken as a \+ pilāpana \+ tā (fr pilavati, *plu*), but whether the der. & interpret. of Dhs A is correct, we are unable to say. On general principles it looks like popular etym. Mrs. Rh. D. translates (p. 16 “opposite of superficiality” (lit “not floating”); see her detailed note *Dhs trsl.* 16.
