Koñca1

the heron, often in combn with mayūra (peacock): Thag.1113; Vv.11#1, Vv.35#8 Ja.v.304; Ja.vi.272; or with *[haṃsa](haṃsa.md)* Pv.ii.12#3  
■ Explained as sārasa Vv\-a.57; jiṇṇa˚ an old heron Dhp.155.

cp. Sk. krauñca & kruñc

Koñca2

= abbr. of koñca\-nāda, trumpeting, in koñcaṃ karoti to trumpet (of elephants) Vin.iii.109; Ja.vi.497.

* *\-[nāda](nāda.md)* the trumpeting of an elephant (“the heron’s cry”) Ja.i.50; Mil.76 (in etymol play with koñca); Vv\-a.35.
* *\-[rāva](rāva.md)* = prec. Dhp\-a.iv.70
* *\-vādikā* a kind of bird Ja.vi.538.

not with Morris, *J.P.T.S.* 1887, 163 sq. to *kruñc*. (meaning to bend, cp. Lat. crux, E. ridge), but prob. a contamination of krośa, fr. *krus* to crow, and kuñja = kuñjara, elephant (q.v.). Partly suggested at Divy.251; see also expln at Vv\-a.35, where this connection is quite evident.
