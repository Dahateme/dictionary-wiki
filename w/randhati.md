1. to be or make subject to, (intrs.) to be in one’s power; (trs.) to harass oppress, vex, hurt (mostly Caus. *[randheti](randheti.md)* = Sk. randhayati). Only in Imper. *randhehi* Ja.i.332, and in Prohib. *mā randhayi* Ja.v.121, and pl. *mā randhayuṃ* Dhp.248 (= mā randhantu mā mathantu Dhp\-a.iii.357) See also *randha2*.
2. to cook (cp. Sk. randhi randhana) Mil.107 (bhojanaṃ randheyya)

pp *randha1*.

*radh* or *randh*, differentiated in Pāli to 2 meanings & 2 verbs according to Dhtm: “hiṃsāyaṃ” (148), and “pāke” (827). In the former sense given as raṇḍ, in the latter *randh*. The root is freq. in the Vedas, in meaning 1. It belongs perhaps to Ags. rendan to rend: see Walde, *Lat. Wtb.* s, v. lumbus
