Uda1

indeclinable disjunctive part. “or” either singly, as at Snp.455, Snp.955, Snp.1090; Ja.v.478 (variant reading udāhu); Mnd.445 (expld. as “padasandhi” with same formula as iti, q.v.); Pv.ii.12#16 (kāyena uda cetasā); or combd. with other synonymous particles, as *uda vā* at Snp.193, Snp.842, Snp.1075; Iti.82 = Iti.117 (caraṃ vā yadi vā tiṭṭhaṃ nisinno uda vā sayaṃ walking or standing, sitting or lying down); Kp\-a.191  
■ See also *[udāhu](udāhu.md)*.

Sk. uta & u, with Lat. aut (or), Gr.; α ̔ϋτι (again), αὐτάρ (but, or), Goth. auk = Ger. auch to pron base ava˚ yonder, cp. ava ii.

Uda2

(˚\-) water, wave. In compounds sometimes the older form udan˚ is preserved (like udañjala, udaññavant), but generally it has been substituted by the later uda˚ (see under *[udakaccha](udakaccha.md)*, udakanti, udakumbha, udapatta udapāna, udabindu).

Vedic udan (nt.), also later uda (but only ˚\-), commonly udaka, q.v.
