only instr. *māsalunā* Mil.292, Trenckner says (note p. 428): “m. is otherwise unknown it must mean a period shorter than 5 months. Cp. Sk. māsala.” Rh. D. (trsl. ii.148) translates “got in a month,” following the Sinhalese gloss. The period seems to be only a *little* shorter than 5 months; there may be a connection with catu in the word.
