in phrase pīti\-vegen;’unna “bubbling up with the excitement of joy” overflowing with joy Mhvs.19, Mhvs.29 (expld. by uggatacitta i.e. lofty, exalted C.)  
■ It may however be better more in keeping with Pāli word\-formation as well as with meaning & interpretation to explain the word as ud na, taking ˚na as abs. (base)\-form of; *nam*, thus lit. “bent up”, i.e. raised, high, in meaning of unnata. Cp. the exactly similar formation, use & meaning of ninna ninnata. Thus unna / ninna would correspond to unnata / ninnata.

pp. of *ud*, unatti & undati, see *[udaka](udaka.md)*
