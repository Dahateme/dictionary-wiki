ancestry, lineage. There is no word in English for *[gotta](gotta.md)*. It includes all those descended, or supposed to be descended, from a common ancestor. A *[gotta](gotta.md)* name is always distinguished from the personal name, the name drawn from place of origin or residence, or from occupation, and lastly from the nick\-name. It probably means agnate rather than cognate. About a score of *[gotta](gotta.md)* names are known They are all assigned to the Buddha’s time. See also Rh. D. *Dialogues* i.27, 195 sq
