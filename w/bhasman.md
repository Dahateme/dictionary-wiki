ashes SN.i.169 = Cnd.576 (loc bhasmani); Vv.84#44; Ja.iii.426; Vism.469 (in comparison).

* *\-antāhuti* (bhasm’ ant’ āhuti) “whose sacrifice ends in ashes” DN.i.55 (so read for bhassant˚, according to DN\-a.i.166, & cp. Franke, *Dīgha Nikāya* p. 60); MN.i.515; SN.iii.207.
* *\-ācchanna* covered by ashes Dhp.71 (= chārikāya paṭichanna Dhp\-a.ii.68); Ja.vi.236 (.… *va pāvaka*)
* *\-puṭa* a sack for ashes DN\-a.i.267 (as expln for assa\-puṭa of DN.i.98; fanciful; see *[assa](assa.md)*1).
* *\-[bhāva](bhāva.md)* “ashy” state state of being crumbled to dust Vv\-a.348.

cp. Vedic bhasman (adj.); Sk. bhasman (n.), originally ppr. of *bhas* to chew & thus n\-stem. It has passed into the a\-decl. in Pali, except in the loc; *bhasmani* (SN.i.169). Etymologically & semantically bhasman is either “chewing” or “anything chewed (small),” thus meaning particle, dust, sand, etc. and *bhas* is another form of *psā* (cp. Sk. psā morsel of food, psāta hungry = P. chāta). Idg \*bhsā & \*bhsam, represented in Gr.; ψώξω to grind ψάμμος & ψ ̈ωξος sand; Lat. sabulum sand. The Dhtp.326 & Dhtm.452 explain; *bhas* by bhasmīkaraṇa “reduce to ashes,” a pp. of it is bhasita; it also occurs in Sk. loc. bhasi
