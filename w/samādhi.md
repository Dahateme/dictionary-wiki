1. concentration; a concentrated, self\-collected, intent state of mind and meditation which, concomitant with right living, is a necessary condition to the attainment of higher wisdom and emancipation. In the *Subha\-suttanta* of the Dīgha (DN.i.209 sq.) samādhi\-khandha (“section on concentration”) is the title otherwise given to the *cittasampadā*, which, in the ascending order of merit accruing from the life of a samaṇa (see *Sāmaññaphala\-suttanta*, and cp. *Dial.* i.57 sq.) stands between the *sīla\-sampadā* and the *paññā\-sampadā*. In the *Ambaṭṭha\-sutta* the corresponding terms are sīla, *[caraṇa](caraṇa.md)*, vijjā (DN.i.100) Thus *[samādhi](samādhi.md)* would comprise
   1. the guarding of the senses (indriyesu gutta\-dvāratā),
   2. self\-possession (sati\-sampajañña),
   3. contentment (santuṭṭhi),
   4. emancipation from the 5 hindrances (nīvaraṇāni)
   5. the 4 jhānas.

   In the same way we find *[samādhi](samādhi.md)* grouped as one of the *sampadās* at AN.iii.12 (sīla˚ samādhi˚, paññā˚, vimutti˚), and as *samādhi\-khandha* (with sīla˚ & paññā˚) at DN.iii.229 (\+ vimutti˚); AN.i.125 AN.ii.20; AN.iii.15; AN.v.326; Mnd.21; Cnd.p.277 (s. v. sīla) It is defined as *cittassa ekaggatā* MN.i.301; Dhs.15; Dhs\-a.118; cp. *Cpd.* 89 n. 4; identified with *[avikkhepa](avikkhepa.md)* Dhs.57, and with *[samatha](samatha.md)* Dhs.54  
   ■ *sammā˚*; is one the constituents of the eightfold ariya\-magga, e.g. DN.iii.277 Vb\-a.120 sq  
   ■ See further DN.ii.123 (ariya); Vin.i.97 Vin.i.104; SN.i.28; Mnd.365; Mil.337; Vism.84 sq. (with definition), Vism.289 (\+ vipassanā), Vism.380 (˚vipphārā iddhi) Vb\-a.91; Dhp\-a.i.427; and on term in general Heiler *Buddhistische Versenkung* 104 sq.
2. Description & characterization of *[samādhi](samādhi.md)*: Its four *nimittas* or signs are the four *satipaṭṭhānas* MN.i.301; six conditions and six hindrances AN.iii.427; other hindrances MN.iii.158. The second jhāna is born from samādhi DN.ii.186; it is a condition for attaining kusalā dhammā AN.i.115; Mil.38; conducive to insight AN.iii.19, AN.iii.24 sq., AN.iii.200; SN.iv.80; to seeing heavenly sights etc. DN.i.173; to removing mountains etc. AN.iii.311; removes the delusions of self AN.i.132 sq.; leads to Arahantship AN.ii.45 the ānantarika s. Snp.226; cetosamādhi (rapture of mind) DN.i.13; AN.ii.54; AN.iii.51; SN.iv.297; *citta˚*; id. Ne.16. *dhammasamādhi* almost identical with samatha SN.iv.350 sq  
   ■ Two grades of samādhi distinguished viz. *[upacāra](upacāra.md)* \-s. (preparatory concentration) and *[appanā](appanā.md)* \-s (attainment concentration) DN\-a.i.217; Vism.126; *Cpd.* 54, 56 sq.; only the latter results in jhāna; to these a 3rd (preliminary) grade is added as *khaṇika˚*; (momentary at Vism.144  
   ■ Three kinds of s. are distinguished *[suññata](suññata.md)* or empty, *[appaṇihita](appaṇihita.md)* or aimless, and *animitta* or signless AN.i.299; SN.iv.360; cp. SN.iv.296; Vin.iii.93; Mil.337; Mil.333 sq.; Dhs\-a.179 sq., Dhs\-a.222 sq., Dhs\-a.290 sq. see *Yogāvacara’s Manual* p. xxvii; samādhi (tayo samādhī) is savitakka savicāra, avitakka vicāramatta or avitakka avicāra DN.iii.219; Kv.570; cp. 413; Mil.337; Dhs\-a.179 sq.; it is *fourfold* chanda\-, viriya\-, citta\-, and vīmaṃsā\-samādhi DN.ii.213; SN.v.268  
   ■ Another fourfold division is that into hāna\-bhāgiya, ṭhiti˚, visesa˚ nibbedha˚ DN.iii.277 (as “dhammā duppaṭivijjhā”).

* *\-[indriya](indriya.md)* the faculty of concentration AN.ii.149; Dhs.15
* *\-[khandha](khandha.md)* the section on s. see above 1.
* *\-[ja](ja.md)* produced by concentration DN.i.74; DN.iii.13; Vism.158.
* *\-[parikkhāra](parikkhāra.md)* requisite to the attainment of samādhi: either 4 (the sammappadhānas) MN.i.301; or 7: DN.ii.216; DN.iii.252; AN.iv.40.
* *\-[bala](bala.md)* the power of concentration AN.i.94 AN.ii.252; DN.iii.213, DN.iii.253; Dhs.28.
* *\-[bhāvanā](bhāvanā.md)* cultivation attainment of samādhi MN.i.301; AN.ii.44 sq. (four different kinds mentioned); iii.25 sq.; DN.iii.222; Vism.371
* *\-[saṃvattanika](saṃvattanika.md)* conducive to concentration AN.ii.57; SN.iv.272 sq.; DN.iii.245; Dhs.1344.
* *\-[sambojjhaṅga](sambojjhaṅga.md)* the s. constituent of enlightment DN.iii.106, DN.iii.226, DN.iii.252 Vism.134 = Vb\-a.283 (with the eleven means of cultivating it).
