adjective “having become very pale” (?), or “somewhat pale” (?), with dubbaṇṇa in Kp\-a.234, and in a stock phrase of three different settings, viz.

1. kiso lūkho dubbaṇṇo upp˚ dhamani\-santhata\-gatto Vin.i.276 Vin.iii.19, Vin.iii.110; MN.ii.121; distorted to BSk. bhīto utp˚. kṛśāluko durbalako mlānako at Divy.334
2. kiso upp˚. Ja.vi.71; Dhp\-a.iv.66
3. upp˚ dhamanisanth˚ Ja.i.346; Ja.ii.92 Ja.v.95; Dhp\-a.i.367. Besides in a doubtful passage at Pv.ii.1#12 (upakaṇḍakin, variant reading uppaṇḍ˚ BB.), expld. at Pv\-a.72 “upakaṇḍakajāta”, vv.ll. uppaṇḍaka˚ and uppaṇḍupaṇḍuka˚.

redupl. intens. formation; ud \+ paṇḍu \+ ka \+ jāta; paṇḍu yellowish. The word is evidently a corruption of something else, perhaps upapaṇṇḍuka upa in meaning of “somewhat like”, cp. upanīla upanibha etc. and reading at Pv.ii.1#13 upakaṇḍakin. The latter may itself be a corruption, but is expld. at Pv\-a.72 by upakaṇḍaka\-jāta “shrivelled up all over, nothing but pieces (?)”. The trsln. is thus doubtful; the BSk. is the P. form retranslated into utpāṇḍuka Divy.334, Divy.463, and translated “very pale”
