˚\-

1. spoiling, impairing, defiling Ja.v.267 (manaṃ)
2. reducing, cutting short only in phrase *upahacca\-parinibbāyin* “coming to extinction after reducing the time of rebirths (or after having almost reached the destruction of life”) SN.v.70, SN.v.201 sq. AN.i.233 sq.; AN.iv.380; Pp.17 (upagantvā kālakiriyaṃ āyukkhayassa āsane ṭhatvā ti attho Pp\-a.199); Ne.190

■ The term is not quite clear; there seems to have existed very early confusion with upapacca → upapajja → uppajja, as indicated by BSk. upapadya\-parinirvāyin, and by remarks of C. on Kv.268, as quoted at *Kvu trsln.* 158, 159.

ger. of upahanti
