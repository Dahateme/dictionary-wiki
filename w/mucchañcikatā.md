(˚añji˚) is probably the correct reading for *[puñcikatā](puñcikatā.md)*  
■ We find *[puñcikatā](puñcikatā.md)* at Dhs.1136, Dhs.1230 Vb.351, Vb.361 (variant reading pucchañji˚); Dhs\-a.365; *mucchañci˚* at Mnd.8 & Cnd p. 152; *pucchañji˚*; at Vb\-a.477. The meaning is “agitation,” as seen from expln of term at Dhs\-a.365 (“wagging of a dog’s tail,” pucchaṃ cāleti) and Vb\-a.477 (“lābhan’ âlābhanaka\-ṭhāne vedhanā kampanā nīcavuttatā”)  
■ The etym. expln is difficult we may take it as a (misunderstood) corruption of *\*mucch\-aṅgi\-kata* i.e. mucchā \+ anga \+ *kṛ*; “being made stiff\-of\-limbs,” or “swoon.” Psychologically we may take “swoon” as the climax of agitation, almost like “hysterics.” A similar case of a similar term of swooning being interpreted by Bdhgh as “wavering (*cal*) is *[chambhitatta](chambhitatta.md)* “paralysis,” explained as “sakalasarīra *calanaṃ*” at DN\-a.i.50  
■ The expression *[mucchañcikatā](mucchañcikatā.md)* reminds us of the term *[kaṭukañcukatā](kaṭukañcukatā.md)*.
