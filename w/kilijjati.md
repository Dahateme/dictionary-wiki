to become heated, to get into a state of inflammation, to fester (of wounds) Vin.i.205 (vaṇo kilijjittha festered); Snp.671 (gloss for kilissati, explained at Snp\-a.481 by pūti hoti)  
pp *[kilinna](kilinna.md)*. See also *[ukkiledeti](ukkiledeti.md)* (to clean out a stain, to “disinfect”).

med\-pass. of *kilid* = Sk. *klid*, to be wet. prob. = *śliṣ* to stick to, and confounded with *svid*, cp. also kelana & khela. The meaning “to get wet, to be soiled” only in pp. *[kilinna](kilinna.md)*  
■ The Dhtm (199), however explains k. by parideva lament, to be in trouble, which is not quite in harmony with the meaning; it is more likely that in P. we have a confusion between *klid kliś* in a meaning which differs from Sk.
