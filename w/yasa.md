Yaso & Yasa

neuter glory, fame, repute success, high position. On term as used with ref. to the brahmin see Fick, *Sociale Gliederung* 128, 129. The prevailing idea of Dhammapāla is that yaso consists of a great retinue, & company of servants, followers etc. This idea is already to be found at DN.i.118 = DN.i.126 where y. is founded on *[parisā](parisā.md)* (cp. DN\-a.i.143 on DN.i.48; DN\-a.i.298: yasasā ti āṇā\-ṭhapana\-samatthatāya). See e.g. Vv\-a.122 (yaso = parivāra); Pv\-a.137 (yasasā mahati parivāra\-sampattiyā); cp. Ja.i.134 (rājā mahantena yasena uppanaṃ gacchati)  
■ DN.i.137 (as quality of a king); DN.iii.260, DN.iii.286; Ja.iv.275 sq. (dibba y. as one of the 10 qualities of greatness, viz. divine duration of life, complexion, happiness, fame, power, and the 5 sense\-objects rūpa, sadda, gandha, rasa, phoṭṭhabba The same 10 are found at Pv.ii.958, 59); AN.i.15; AN.ii.32 AN.ii.66, AN.ii.188; AN.iii.31, AN.iii.47 sq.; AN.iv.95, AN.iv.195 sq.; Dhp.24, Dhp.303 (\+ bhoga); Thag.554; Mnd.147; Pv.iii.3#5 (= dev’ iddhi Pv\-a.189); Vv.29#1; Ja.i.134; Ja.vi.468; Mil.291 (bhoga \+) Vism.393; Sdhp.306, Sdhp.518  
■ *yasaṃ deti* to give credit Ja.i.180. *mahā\-yaso* great fame Ja.i.46 (v. 266), cp *yas\-agga* the highest (of) fame Ja.i.51, where coupled with *lābh\-agga* the greatest gain. The latter combination is stereotype in the Niddesa (see e.g. Cnd.55), where the 4 worldly ideals are given in sequence lābha, yaso pasaṃsā, sukha  
■ With *[kitti](kitti.md)* we find yaso at Snp.817 (see defn & exegesis at Mnd.147)  
■ Opp. *[ayasa](ayasa.md)* DN.iii.260, DN.iii.286; AN.ii.188; AN.iv.157 sq.

* *\-[dāyika](dāyika.md)* giving (or a giver of) repute Ja.vi.285
* *\-mada* pride of fame Vb\-a.467
* *\-mahatta* greatness of fame Vism.233
* *\-lābha* the gain of fame Ja.iii.516 (\+ dhanalābha)

Vedic yaśaḥ (nt.). The word follows the *a˚*; declension, but preserves & favours the instr; *yasasā* after the *s˚*; decl. (like mano, ceto etc,), e.g. at Ja.i.134  
■ In the nom. & acc. sg. both forms; *yaso yasa(ṃ);* occur; in compounds the form *yasa˚*; is the usual yaso as *masc.* is found at Snp.438
