indeclinable again. There are several forms of this adv., but *[puna](puna.md)* has to be considered as the orig. Pali form. The form *puno* is doubtful; if authentic, a Sanskritisation; only found at Thag\-a.71 (Tha\-ap.38; variant reading puna) & Tha\-ap.72 (Tha\-ap.41, variant reading puna). The sandhi; *r* is preserved only in *metre* and in *compn.*. That it is out of fashion even in metre is shown by a form *punā* where *[ā](ā.md)* is the regular metrical lengthening instead of ar (Ja.iii.437: na hi dāni punā atthi; variant reading puna). Besides this the *r* is apparent in the doubling of the first consonants of compounds (punappunaṃ, punabbhava); it is quite lost in the enclitic form *[pana](pana.md)*  
■ We find *r* in punar āgami Snp.339; punar āgato Ja.i.403 (= puna āgato Ja.i.403 (= puna āgato, ra\-kāro sandhivasena vutto C.); in compounds: punar\- *[abhiseka](abhiseka.md)* see *J.P.T.S.* 1885 49; a\-punar *\-āvattitā* the fact of not turning back Mil.276 (cp. Prk. apuṇar\-avatti Pischel, § 343). Otherwise *r* stands on the same level as other sandhi (euphonic) consonants (like m. & d., see below), as in; *puna\-r\-eva* Dhp.338; Pv.ii.8#7; Pv.ii.11#6. We have *m* in puna\-m\-upāgamuṃ Snp.306; puna by itself is rarely found, it is usually combined with other emphatic part like *[eva](eva.md)* and *[api](api.md)*. The meaning is “again,” but in enclitic function (*[puna](puna.md)* still found Snp.677, Snp.876, otherwise *[pana](pana.md)*); it represents “however, but, now” (cp same relation in Ger. abermals: aber), similar to the development in Prk. puṇo vi & puṇar avi “again” puna “now” (Pischel Gr. § 342)  
■ *[puna](puna.md)* by itself at Snp\-a.597; Pv\-a.3, Pv\-a.45; Mhvs.14, Mhvs.12. doubled as *[punappunaṃ](punappunaṃ.md)* SN.i.174; Thag.531, Thag.532; Snp.728, Snp.1051; Dhp.117 Dhp.118, Dhp.325, Dhp.337; Ja.v.208; Snp\-a.107; Pv\-a.45, Pv\-a.47; *punappuna* at Dhp\-a.ii.75; as *puna\-d\-eva* at DN.i.60, DN.i.142; Pv.ii.11#3 (variant reading); Vism.163; Dhp\-a.ii.76; *puna\-m\-eva* Pv.ii.11#3; *puna pi* once more Ja.i.279; Pv\-a.67, Pv\-a.74 *puna\-p\-pi* Ja.v.208. The phrase *puna c’ aparaṃ* “and again something else” stands on the same level as the phrase aparo pi (apare pi), with which one may compare the parallel expressions puna\-divase: aparadivase all of which show the close relation between pi puna, *[apara](apara.md)*, but we never find *[para](para.md)* in these connections Trenckner’s (& following him Oldenberg in Vin and Hardy in A etc.) way of writing; *puna ca paraṃ* (e.g. Mil.201, Mil.388, Mil.418 etc.) is to be corrected to *puna c’ aparaṃ*, cp. punâpara Snp.1004; Cp.iii.6#1.

* *\-[āgamana](āgamana.md)* coming again, return SN.i.22 (a˚).
* *\-[āvāsa](āvāsa.md)* rebirth SN.i.200.
* *\-divase* on the following day Ja.i.278; Pv\-a.19, Pv\-a.38.
* *\-[nivattati](nivattati.md)* to turn back again SN.i.177
* *\-bbhava* renewed existence, new birth DN.ii.15; SN.i.133; Iti.62; SN.iv.201 (āyati˚); Snp.162, Snp.273, Snp.502, Snp.514, Snp.733 Cnd. s.v.; Ne.28, Ne.79 sq.; Pv\-a.63, Pv\-a.200; cp. ponobhavika; *a˚*; no more rebirth SN.i.174, SN.i.208; Cnd.64;
* *\-ābhinibbatti* birth in a new existence MN.i.294; SN.ii.65; AN.i.223; Vin.iii.3; Pv\-a.35.
* *\-[vacana](vacana.md)* repetition Snp\-a.487.
* *\-vāre* (loc.) another time Ja.v.21.

cp. Vedic punar, punaḥ, to base \*pŭ (related to \*apo: see *apa*), as in puccha tail, Lat puppis, poop, Gr. πύματος the last; orig. meaning “behind”
