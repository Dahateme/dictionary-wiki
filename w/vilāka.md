adjective only in f *\-a*: slender (of waist); the expln with *[vilagga](vilagga.md)* may refer to a comparison with a creeper (cp. vilambin & Ja.v.215 as “hanging” (“climbing”) i.e. slim, but seems forced See also *[virāgita](virāgita.md)* which is explained in the same way. The word is peculiar to the “Jātaka” style  
■ Ja.iv.19 (= suṭṭhu\- *[vilaggita](vilaggita.md)* \-tanu\-majjhā); Ja.v.155 (\+ mudukā; C explains as sankhitta\-majjhā), Ja.v.215 (˚majjhā = vilaggasarīrā C.), Ja.v.506 (velli\-vilāka\-majjhā = vilagga\-majjhā tanu\-dīgha\-majjhā C.); Vv\-a.280 (˚majjhā for sumajjhimā of Vv.64#13; T. reads *vilāta˚*;).

perhaps = vilagga (Geiger, *P.Gr.* § 612), although difficult to connect in meaning
