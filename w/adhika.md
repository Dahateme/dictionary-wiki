adjective exceeding, extraordinary, superior, Pp.35; Vv\-a.80 (= anadhivara, visiṭṭha); DN\-a.i.141, DN\-a.i.222; Dpvs.v.32 (an˚); Dhp\-a.iii.238 Kp\-a.193 (= anuttara); Sdhp.337, Sdhp.447  
■ compar *[adhikatara](adhikatara.md)* Dhp\-a.ii.7; Dhp\-a.iii.176; nt. *\-ṃ* as adv. extraordinarily Pv\-a.86 (= adhimattaṃ). In combn. with *numerals* adhika has the meaning of “in addition, with an additional, plus” (cp. ādi \+ ādika, with which it is evidently confounded, adhika being constructed in the same way as ādika, i.e. preceding the noun\-determination), e.g. catunahutâdhikāni dve yojana\-sahassāni 2000 \+ 94 (= 294 000; Ja.i.25; sattamāsâdhikāni sattavassāni 7 years and 7 months Ja.v.319; paññāsâdhikāni pañca vassa\-satani 500 \+ 50 (550) Pv\-a.152.
