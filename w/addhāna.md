same meaning as *[addhan](addhan.md)* but as simplex only used with reference to time (i.e. a long time, cp. Vv\-a.117 addhānaṃ = ciraṃ). Usually in phrase *atītaṃ* (anāgataṃ etc.) *addhānaṃ* in the past (future etc.), e.g. DN.i.200; SN.i.140; AN.v.32; Mil.126 (anāgatamaddhāne for ˚aṃ); Pv\-a.75 (variant reading addhāne). *dīghaṃ addhānaṃ* Pv.i.10#5. Also in phrase *addhānaṃ āpādeti* to make out the length of time or period, i.e. to live out one’s lifetime SN.iv.110; Ja.ii.293 (= jīvitaddhānaṃ āpādi āyuṃ vindi C).

* *\-[daratha](daratha.md)* exhaustion from travelling DN\-a.i.287.
* *\-[magga](magga.md)* a (proper) road for journeying, a long road between two towns, high road DN.i.1, DN.i.73, DN.i.79; MN.i.276 (kantār˚) DN\-a.i.35 (interpreted as “addhayojanaṃ gacchissāmī ti bhuñjitabban ti ādi vacanato addha\-yojanam pi addhāna maggo hoti”, thus taken to addha “half”, from counting by 1/2 miles); Vv\-a.40, Vv\-a.292. Cp. also antarāmagga.
* *\-[parissama](parissama.md)* “fatigue of the road”, i.e. fatigue from travelling Vv\-a.305.
* *\-[vemattatā](vemattatā.md)* difference of time or period Mil.285 (\+ āyuvemattatā).

orig. the acc. of *[addhan](addhan.md)*, taken as nt. from phrase dīghaṃ addhānaṃ. It occurs only in acc. which may always be taken as acc. of addhan; thus the assumption of a special form addhāna would be superfluous were it not for later forms like addhāne (loc.) Mil.126; Pv\-a.75 variant reading BB, and for compounds
