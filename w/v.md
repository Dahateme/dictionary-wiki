\-V\-

euphonic (sandhi\-) consonant, historically justified after *[u](u.md)* (uv from older v), as in *su\-v\-ānaya* easy to bring (SN.i.124); hence transferred to *[i](i.md)*, as in *ti\-v\-aṅgika* threefold (Dhs.161), and *ti\-v\-aṅgula* three inches wide (Vism.152, Vism.408); perhaps also in *anu\-v\-icca* (see *[anuvicca](anuvicca.md)*).
