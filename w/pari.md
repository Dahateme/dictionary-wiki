Pari˚

indeclinable prefix, signifying (lit. around, round about; (fig.) all round, i.e. completely altogether. The use as *prep.* (with acc. = against, w abl. = from) has entirely disappeared in Pāli (but see below 1a). As *adv.* “all round” it is only found at Ja.vi.198 (parī metri causa; combined with samantato). The composition form before vowels is *pariy˚*; which in combination with *ud* and *[upa](upa.md)* undergoes metathesis, scil *payir˚*. Frequent combinations with other preps. are pari \+ *[ā](ā.md)* (pariyā˚) and pari \+ *ava* (pariyo˚); *sampari˚*; Close affinities of p. are the preps. *[adhi](adhi.md)* (cp. ajjhesati → pariyesati, ajjhogāhati → pariyogāhati) and *abhi* (cp abhirādheti → paritoseti, abhitāpa → paritāpa, abhipīḷita → pari˚, abhipūreti → pari˚, abhirakkhati → pari˚), cp also its relation to *[ā](ā.md)* in var. combinations
