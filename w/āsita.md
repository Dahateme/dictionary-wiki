\*Āsita1

“having eaten”, but probably *māsita* (pp. of *mṛś* to touch, cp. Sk. mṛśita, which is ordinarily in massita), since it only occurs in combns. where m precedes, viz. Ja.ii.446 (dumapakkani\-m\-asita, where C reading is māsita & expln. khāditvā asita (variant reading āsita) dhāta) Mil.302 (visam\-āsita affected with poison = visamāsita) Cp. also the form *māsi(n)* touching, eating at Ja.vi.354 (tiṇa˚, expld. by C. as khādaka)  
■ *āsita* at Ja.v.70 is very doubtful, variant reading āsina & asita; C. explains by dhāta suhita p.73\*Asita

= asita1?

\*Āsita2

at Vv\-a.276 is better read with variant reading SS *[bhāsita](bhāsita.md)* (\-vādana etc.).
