### I. *Forms* ###

The 2 bases *muñc˚* & *mucc˚;* are differentiated in such a way, that *muñc˚*; is the *active* base, and *mucc˚*; the *passive.* There are however cases where the active forms (muñc˚) are used for the passive ones (mucc˚), which may be due simply to a misspelling ñc & cc being very similar

### II. *Meanings* ###

1. to release, deliver (from = abl.), set free (opp. bandhati Snp.508 (sujjhati, m., bajjhati); SN.iii.132 (cittāni mucciṃsu their hearts were cleansed), Thig.2 (muccassu) Dhp.127 (pāpakammā, quoted at Pv\-a.104); Pv.ii.2#6 Pv\-a.53 (niray’ ûpapattito muccissati), Pv\-a.105; Dhp\-a.i.297 (dukkhā muccitu\-kāma desirous of being delivered from unpleasantness; variant reading muñc˚); Dhp\-a.ii.92 (dukkhā).
2. to send off, let loose, drop, give Ja.iv.272 (saraṃ an arrow); Vism.313 (dhenu vacchakassa khīra\-dhāraṃ m.); Mhvs.25, Mhvs.63 (phalakaṃ).
3. to let out of the yoke, to unharness, set free DN.i.148 (satta usabhasatāni muñcāpeti); Pv\-a.43 (yoggāni muñcitvā).
4. to let go, emit, send forth (light) Ja.v.289 (obhāsaṃ muñci); Mhvs.19, Mhvs.44 (rasmiyo).
5. to send forth (sound); to utter, emit (words etc.) Ja.i.375 (vācaṃ) Vv.64#18 (mālā m. ghosaṃ = vissajjenti Vv\-a.281).
6. (from 4 & 5 in general) to undertake, to bestow, send forth, let loose on Dhp.389: “na brāhmaṇassa pahareyya nâssa muñcetha brāhmaṇo,” where Dhp\-a.iv.148 supplements *veran* na muñcetha (i.e. kopaṃ na kareyya) In this case veraṃ *muñcati* would be the same as the usual veraṃ *bandhati*, thus opposite notions being used complementarily. The interpretation “give up (enmity) instead of “undertake” is possible from a mere grammatical point of view. L. v. Sohroeder *(Worte der Wahrheil)* trsls “noch stürzt der Priester auf den Feind”!
7. to abandon, give up, leave behind Dhp.348 (muñca, viz. taṇhaṃ Dhp\-a.iv.63); Ja.v.453 (peta\-rāja\-visayaṃ).
8. An idiomatic (late) use of the ger. *[muñciya](muñciya.md)* (with acc.) is in the sense of an adv. (or prep.), meaning “except, besides,” e.g. maṃ m Mhvs.25, Mhvs.67; imaṃ m. (besides this Mhvs.14, Mhvs.17)

■ Cp pa˚, paṭi˚, vi˚. *Note.* At Dhp.71 *[muccati](muccati.md)* stands for *muccheti* (= Sk. mūrchati) to become stiff, coagulate curdle; cp. Dhp\-a.ii.67. Muncana & Muccana;

Vedic muñcati; *muc*, to release, loosen; with orig. meaning “strip off, get rid of,” hence also “glide as in Lith. mūkti to escape, Ags. smūgan to creep Ger. schmiegen to rub against. See further connections in Walde, *Lat. Wtb.*, s. v. emungo. The Dhtp.376 explains by mocane, Dhtm.609 id.; 631: moce; 765 pamocane
