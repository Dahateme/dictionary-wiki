(gradually) getting light; turning into dawn (said of the night), only in phrase *ratyā vivasane* at the end of night, combined in stock phrase with *suriy’ uggamanaṃ pati* “towards sunrise” (evidently an old phrase) at Thag.517; Ja.iv.241; Ja.v.381, Ja.v.461; Ja.vi.491; Pv.iii.8#2. Also at Snp.710.

vi \+ *vas (uṣ)* to shine, cp. vibhāti
