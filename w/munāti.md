to be a wise man or muni, to think, ponder, to know Dhp.269 (yo munāti ubho loke munī tena pavuccati), which is expld at Dhp\-a.iii.396 as follows: “yo puggalo… tulaṃ āropetvā minanto viya ime ajjhattikā khandhā ime bāhirā ti ādinā nayena ime ubho pi atthe mināti munī tena pavuccati.” *Note.* The word occurs also in Māgadhī (Prk.) as muṇaï which as Pischel (*Prk. Gr.* § 489) remarks, is usually taken to *man*, but against this speaks its meaning “to know” & Pāli munāti. He compares maṇaï with Vedic mūta in kāma\-mūta (driven by kāma; mūta = pp. of *mū = mīv*) and Sk. muni. Cp animo movere.

= manyate, prob. corresponding to Sk. med. manute, with inversion \*munati and analogy formation after jānāti as *[munāti](munāti.md)*, may be in allusion to Sk. mṛṇāti of *mṛ*; to crush, or also *[mā](mā.md)* mināti to measure out or fathom. The Dhtm.589 gives as root *mun* in meaning “ñāṇa.” The word is more a Com. word than anything else, formed from muni & in order to explain it
