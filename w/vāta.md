wind. There exists a common distinction of winds into 2 groups: “internal and “external” winds, or the *ajjhattikā* vāyo\-dhātu (wind category), and the *bāhirā*. They are discussed at Vb.84, quoted at MN\-a.30, MN\-a.31, and explained in detail at Vb\-a.70 sq.; Vism.350. The *bāhirā* also at Cnd.562 and in poetical form at SN.iv.218

Their complement are the *external* winds (see below 1), viz. puratthimā *vātā* pacchimā, uttarā, dakkhiṇā (from the 4 quarters of the sky), sarajā arajā, sītā uṇhā, parittā adhimattā, kāḷā verambha˚, pakkha˚, supaṇṇa˚, tālavanta˚, vidhūpana ˚ These are characterized according to direction dust, temperature, force, height & other causes (like fanning etc.).
