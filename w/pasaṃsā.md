praise, applause DN.iii.260; SN.i.202; Thag.609; Snp.213, Snp.826 Snp.895; Mil.377; Snp\-a.155. In composition the form is *pasaṃsa˚*; e.g. *\-āvahana* bringing applause Snp.256 *\-kāma* desirous of praise Snp.825, cp. Mnd.163; *\-lābha* gain of praise Snp.828. As adj. *pasaṃsa* “laudable praiseworthy” it is better taken as grd. of pasaṃsati (= pasaṃsiya); thus at Pv.iv.7#13 (pāsaṃsa Minayeff) Pv\-a.8, Pv\-a.89 (= anindita).

fr. pa \+ *śaṃs*; cp. Vedic praśaṃsā
