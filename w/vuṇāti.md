\*Vuṇāti

The two meanings of the root *vṛ*; as existing in Sk. are also found in Pāli but only peculiar to the Caus. *[vāreti](vāreti.md)* (the form aor *avari* as given by Childers should be read *avāriṃsu* Mhvs.36, Mhvs.78). The present tense *varati* is only found in meaning “to wish” (except in prep. compounds like *[saṃvarati](saṃvarati.md)* to restrain)  
■ Defns of *vṛ*: Dhtp.255 *var* varaṇa\-sambhattisu; 274 *val* = saṃvaraṇe (see *[valaya](valaya.md)*), 606 *var* = āvaraṇ’icchāsu.

1. to hinder, obstruct; to conceal, protect (on meanings “hinder” and “conceal” cp. *[rundhati](rundhati.md)*); Idg. *\*ṷer* and *\*ṷel*, cp. Gr. ε ̓́λυτρον Sk. varutra, Lat. volvo, aperio etc. See *[vivarati](vivarati.md)*. The pp. *\*vuta* only in combination with prefixes, like pari˚, saṃ˚ It also appears as *\*vaṭa* in vivaṭa.
2. to wish, desire Idg. *\*ṷel*, cp. Sk. varaṇa, varīyān “better,” Gr. ε ̓́λδομαι to long for, Lat. volo to intend, Goth. wiljan to “will, wilja = E. will«

pres *varati* (cp. vaṇeti): imper *varassu* Ja.iii.493 (varaṃ take a wish; Pot. *vare* Pv.ii.9#40 (= vareyyāsi C.); ppr. *varamāna* Pv.ii.9#40 (= patthayamāna Pv\-a.128)

pp does not occur.

we are giving this base as such only from analogy with the Sanskrit form *vrṇāti* (vṛṇoti); from the point of view of *Pāli* grammar we must consider a present tense *varati* as legitimate (cp. saṁ˚). There are *no* forms from the base *vuṇāti* found in the present tense; the Caus *vāreti* points directly to *varati*.
