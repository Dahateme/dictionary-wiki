Agha1

neuter evil, grief, pain, suffering, misfortune SN.i.22; MN.i.500 (*roga gaṇḍa salla agha*); AN.ii.128 (id.); Ja.v.100; Thig.491; Sdhp.51  
■ adj. painful, bringing pain Ja.vi.507 (agha\-m\-miga = aghakara m. C.). *\-[bhūta](bhūta.md)* a source of pain SN.iii.189 (\+ agha & salla).

cp. Sk. agha, of uncertain etym.

Agha2

masculine neuter the sky, orig. the dark sky, dark space, the abyss of space DN.ii.12; SN.v.45; Vv.16#1 (aghasi gama, loc. vehāsaṃ gama Vv\-a.78); Ja.iv.154; Dhs.638 (\+ aghagata) Vb.84 (id.).

* *\-[gata](gata.md)* going through or being in the sky or atmosphere Dhs.638, Dhs.722; Vb.84.
* *\-gāmin* moving through the atmosphere or space i.e. a planet SN.i.67 = Mil.242 (ādicco seṭṭho aghagāminaṃ).

the etym. suggested by Morris J.P.T.S. 1889, 200 (with ref. to MN.i.500, which belongs under agha1) is untenable (to Sk. kha, as a\-kha = agha, cp Jain Prk. khaha). Neither does the pop. etym. of Bdhgh offer any clue (= a \+ gha from *ghan* that which does not strike or aghaṭṭaniya is not strikeable Dhs\-a.326 cp. Dhs. trsl. 194 & Ja.iv.154 aghe ṭhitā = appaṭighe ākāse ṭhitā the air which does not offer any resistance) On the other hand the primary meaning is *darkness*, as seen from the phrase *lokantarikā aghā asaṃvutā andhakārā* DN.ii.12; SN.v.454, and BSk. *aghasaṃvṛta* Mvu.i.240, adj. dark Mvu.i.41; Mvu.ii.162; Lal.552
