indeclinable both prep. & conj., orig meaning “close by”, then as prep. “towards, to, on to on” and as adv. “later, and, moreover”.

1. (prep. pref.)
   1. prep. c. loc.: *api ratte* later on in the night (q.v.)\-
   2. pref.: *[apidhāna](apidhāna.md)* putting on to; *apiḷahati* bind on to, apihita (= Gr. ἐπιχετός, epithet) put on to (q.v.).

2. (conj. & part.).
   1. in affirmative sentences meaning primarily “moreover, further, and then, even”
      1.

Out of prothetic use (= even = even if) develops the conditional meaning of “if”, as in api sakkuṇemu (and then we may = if we may) Ja.v.24 (c. = api nāma sakkuṇeyyāma see further under β app’eva nāma)  
         ■ *api\-api* in correlation corresponds to Lat. et\-et Sk ca\-ca, meaning both… and, and… as well as, & is esp. freq. in combn. *app’ ekacce… app’ ekacce* (and) some… and others i.e. some… others [*not* with Kern
