adjective autumnal, of the latest harvest, this year’s, fresh AN.iii.404 = DN.iii.354 (*bījāni* fresh seeds); AN.i.135, AN.i.181 (badara\-paṇḍu) SN.iii.54; SN.v.380; Mil.255; Dhp.149 (but at this passage explained as “scattered by the autumn winds” Dhp\-a.iii.112)\- *asārada* stale, old DN.ii.353; SN.v.379. Fig. *[sārada](sārada.md)* unripe not experienced, immature (see *[sārajja](sārajja.md)* shyness) opp. *[visārada](visārada.md)* (der. vesārajja) experienced, wise, selfconfident; *vīta\-sārada* id. (e.g. AN.ii.24; Iti.123)  
■ *Note:* At *K.S.* iii.46 (= SN.iii.54) s. is wrongly taken as *sāra \+ da* i.e. “giving sāra”; but ‣Seeds do not *give* sāra: they *contain* sāra (cp. sāravant). The Commentarial explanation as *sār\-ādāyin* is nearer the truth, but of course not literal; *\-da* is not *ā \+ ˚da*. Moreover, the figuratively meaning cannot be reconciled with this explanation.

Vedic śārada, fr. śarad autumn (of Babyl. origin? cp. Assyr. šabātu corn month)
