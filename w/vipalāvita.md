made to float, floating, thrown out (into water) Ja.iv.259 (reads viplāvitaṃ) = Ja.i.326 (reads vipalāvitaṃ, with reading *nipalāvitaṃ* in C.). The C. at Ja.iv.259 explains as “*[uttārita](uttārita.md)*,” so at Ja.i.326 as “brought *out* of water,” fished out = thale ṭhapita, evidently incorrect.

vi \+ palāvita, pp. of Caus. of *plu*
