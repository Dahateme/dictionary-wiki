talk, recitation, disputation; invitation (?), in *brāhmaṇa˚*; Ja.i.318 (karoti); Ja.iii.171, Ja.iv.391 (karoti); regarded as a kind of festival. At Ja.iii.238 *[vācanaka](vācanaka.md)* is used by itself (two brahmins *receiving* it). It refers to the treating of brāhmaṇas (br. teachers) on special occasions (on behalf of their pupils: a sort of farewell\-dinner?)  
■ It is not quite sure how we have to interpret *[vācanaka](vācanaka.md)*. Under *[brāhmaṇa](brāhmaṇa.md)* (compounds) we have trsld it as “elocution show (cp. our “speech day”). The E. translation gives “brahmin feast”; Prof. Dutoit “Brahmanen\-backwerk” (i.e. special cakes for br.). *[vācana](vācana.md)* *may* be a distortion of *vājana*, although the latter is never found as variant reading It is at all events a singular expression. BR give *[vācanaka](vācanaka.md)* as α ̔́πας λεγομένον in meaning of “sweetmeat,” with the only ref. Hārāvalī 152 (Calc. ed.), where it is explained as “prahelaka” (see P. *[paheṇaka](paheṇaka.md)*). On the subject see also Fick, *Soc. Glied.* 137, 205.
