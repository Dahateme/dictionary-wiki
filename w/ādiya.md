Ādiya1

adjective grd. of admi, *ad*, Sk. ādya] edible, eatable AN.iii.45 (bhojanāni).

Ādiya2

in *\-mukha* is uncertain reading at AN.iii.164 sq. (vv.ll. ādeyya˚ & ādheyya), meaning perhaps “graspmouth”, i.e. gossip; thus equal to ger. of ādiyati1. Perhaps to be taken to ādiyati2. The same phrase occurs at Pp.65 (T. ādheyya˚, C. has variant reading ādheyya˚) where Pp\-a.248 explains “ādito dheyyamukho, paṭhama\-vacanasmiṃ yeva ṭhapita\-mukho ti attho” (sticking to one’s word?) See *[ādheyya](ādheyya.md)*.

Ādiya3

= ādika, instr. *ādiyena* in the beginning Ja.vi.567 (= ādikena C.).

Ādiya4

ger. of ādiyati.
