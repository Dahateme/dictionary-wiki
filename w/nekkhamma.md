formally a derivation fr. nikkhamma (ger. of nikkhamati) = Sk. \*naiṣkramya, as shown also by its semantic affinity to *[nikkhanta](nikkhanta.md)*, in which the metaphorical sense has entirely superseded the literal one. On the other hand, it may be a bastard derivation fr. nikkāma = Sk. \*naiṣkāmya, although the adj. nikkāma does not show the prevailing meaning & the wide range of nikkhanta, moreover formally we should expect nekkamma. In any case the connection with; *[kāma](kāma.md)* is pre\-eminently felt in the connotation of n., as shown by var. passages where a play of word exists between n & kāma (cp. kāmānaṃ nissaraṇaṃ yad idaṃ nekkhammaṃ Iti.61, cp. Vin.i.104; AN.iii.245; also MN.i.115). The use of the similar term abhinikkhamana further warrants its derivation fr. nikkhamati
