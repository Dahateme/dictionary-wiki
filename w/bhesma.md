adjective terrible, awful Vin.ii.203 = Iti.86 (“bhesmā hi udadhī mahā,” so read for *Vin.* bhasmā with variant reading bhesmā, and for *It* tasmā, with variant reading BB bhesmā, misunderstood by ed  
■ Bdhgh Vin.ii.325 on *Vin.* passage explains by bhayānaka); Ja.v.266; Ja.vi.133 (variant reading bhasma).

cp. Vedic bhīṣma of which the regular P. form is *[bhiṃsa](bhiṃsa.md)*, of *bhī*; bhesma would correspond to a form \*bhaiṣma
