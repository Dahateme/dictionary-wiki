Vetulla & vetulya

a certain dissenting sect (see *Mvu. translation* 259, n. 2) in *\-vāda* heretic doctrine Mhvs.36, Mhvs.41; Dpvs.22, 45; *\-vādin* an adherent of this doctrine.

cp. \*Sk. vaitulya; also called vaipulya, fr. *[vipula](vipula.md)*. The P. form is not clear; it probably rests on dial. translation of a later term
