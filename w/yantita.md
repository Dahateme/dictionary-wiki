made to go, set into motion, impelled Thag.574: evâyaṃ vattati kāyo kamma\-yantena yantito “impelled by the machinery of Karma” translation *Brethren* 261 not quite to the point “carried about on Karma’s car.” Kern,

 s, v. quite out of place with “fettered, held, restrained,” in analogy to his translation of *[yanta](yanta.md)* id. loc. with “fetter.” He may have been misled by Dhtm defn of *yant* as “sankocana (see *[yanteti](yanteti.md)*).
