Dhamma1

masculine & rarely neuter constitution etc.

### A. *Definitions by Commentators* ###

Bdhgh gives a fourfold meaning of the word dhamma (at DN\-a.i.99; Dhp\-a.i.22), viz. 1 guṇe (saddo), applied to good conduct 2 desanāyaṃ, to preaching & moral instruction 3 pariyattiyaṃ, to the 9 fold collection of the Buddh Scriptures (see navanga); 4 nissatte (\-nijjīvate), to cosmic (non\-animistic) law  
■ No. 1 is referred to freq in explains of the term, e.g. dhammiko ti ñāyena samena pavattatī ti DN\-a.i.249; dhamman ti kāraṇaṃ ñāyaṃ Pv\-a.211; as paṭipatti\-dhamma at Vv\-a.84; No. 3 e.g. also at Pv\-a.2. Another and more adequate fourfold definition by Bdhgh is given in Dhs\-a.38, viz. 1 pariyatti or doctrine as formulated, 2 hetu, or condition causal antecedent, 3 guṇa, or moral quality or action 4 nissatta\-nijīvatā, or “the phenomenal” as opposed to “the substantial,” “the noumenal,” “animistic entity.” Here (2) is illustrated by hetumhi ñāṇaṃ dhammapaṭisambhidā: “analytic knowledge in dhamma’s means insight into condition, causal antecedent Vb.293, and see *Niyama* (dhamma˚). Since, in the former fourfold definition (2) and (3) really constitute but one main implication considered under the two aspects of Doctrine as taught and Doctrine as formulated we may interpret Dhamma by the fourfold connotation: doctrine, right or righteousness, condition, phenomenon.  
■ For other exegetic definitions see the Coms & the Niddesa, e.g. Mnd.94; for modern explanations & analyses see e.g. Rhys Davids, *Buddh. India* pp. 292–⁠4; Mrs. Rh. Davids, *Buddhism* (1912) pp. 32 sq. 107 sq., 235 sq.; *Dhs. trsl.* xxxiii. sq.; and most recently the exhaustive monograph by M. & W. Geiger, *Pāli Dhamma.* Abhandlungen der Bayer. Akademie xxxi.1; München 1920; which reached the editors too late to be made use of for the Dictionary.

### B. *Applications and Meaning* ###

1. *Psychologically:* “mentality” as the constitutive element of cognition & of its substratum, the world of phenomena. It is that which is presented as “object” to the imagination & as such has an effect of its own; a presentation; *(Vorstellung)*, or *idea*, idea, or purely mental phenomenon as distinguished from a psycho\-physical phenomenon or sensation (re\-action of sense\-organ to sensestimulus). The mind deals with ideas as the eye deals with forms: it is the abstraction formed by mano, or mind proper, from the objects of sense presented by the sense\-organ when reacting to external objects Thus cakkhu “faculty of sight” corresponds to rūpa “relation of form” & *[mano](mano.md)* “faculty of thought (citta & ceto its organ or instrument or localisation corresponds to dhamma “mentalized” object or “idea” (Mrs. Rh. D. “mental object in general,” also “state of mind”)\-
   1. *subjective:* mental attitude thought, idea, philosophy, truth, & its recognition (anubodhi) by the Buddha, i.e. the Dhamma or worldwisdom = philosophy of the Buddha as contained expounded in the Dialogues of the 5 Nikāyas (see below C.)  
      ■ *Note.* The idea of dhamma as the interpreted Order of the World is carried further in the poetical quasi\-personification of the Dh. with the phrase “dhammaja dh\-nimmita dh\-dāyāda” (born of the Norm, created by the Norm, heir of the Norm; see under compounds and Dhammatā; also s. v. Niyama). That which the Buddha preached, the Dhamma κα ̓τ ἐςοξήν, was the order of law of the universe, immanent, eternal uncreated, not as interpreted by him only, much less invented or decreed by him, but intelligible to a mind of his range, and by him made so to mankind as bodhi revelation, awakening. The Buddha (like every great philosopher & other Buddhas preceding Gotama: ye pi te ahesuṃ atītaṃ addhānaṃ Arahanto Sammāsambuddhā te pi dhammaṃ yeva sakkatvā SN.i.140) is a discoverer of this order of the Dhamma, this universal logic, philosophy or righteousness (“Norm”), in which the rational & the ethical elements are fused into one. Thus by recognition of the truth the knower becomes the incorporation of the knowable (or the sense of the universe = Dhamma) & therefore a perfect man one who is “truly enlightened” (sammā\-sambuddha) so Bhagavā jānaṃ jānāti passaṃ passati cakkhu\-bhūto ñāṇa\-bhūto dhamma˚ brahma˚ & in this possession of the truth he is not *like* Brahmā, but Brahmā himself & the lord of the world as the “master of the Truth” vattā pavattā atthassa ninnetā Amatassa dātā dhammassāmī SN.iv.94; & similarly “yo kho Dhammaṃ passati so mam passati; yo mam passati so Dhammaṃ passati = he who sees the Buddha sees the Truth SN.iii.120. Cp with this also the dhamma\-cakka idea (see compounds). On equation Dhamma = Brahman see esp. Geiger, *Dhamma* pp. 76–80, where is also discussed the formula Bhagavato putto etc. (with dhammaja for the brahmanic brahmaja)  
      ■ In later (Abhidhamma) literature the (dogmatic) personification of Dhamma occurs. See e.g. Tikp A 366.  
      ■ As 6th sense\-object “dhamma” is the counterpart of “mano”: manasā dhammaṃ viññāya “apperceiving presentations with the mind” SN.iv.185 etc. (see formula under rūpa); mano\-viññeyyā dhammā SN.iv.73 cp. SN.iii.46; SN.iv.3 sq.; SN.v.74; DN.iii.226, DN.iii.245, DN.iii.269. Ranged in the same category under the anupassanā\-formula (q.v.) “dhammesu dhamm\-ânupassin” realising the mentality of mental objects or ideas, e.g. DN.ii.95, DN.ii.100 DN.ii.299; AN.i.39, AN.i.296; AN.ii.256; AN.iii.450; AN.iv.301. Also as one of the 6 taṇhās “desire for ideas” DN.iii.244, DN.iii.280  
      ■ As spirituality opposed to materiality in contrast of dh. āmisa: Iti.98 (˚dāna: a mat. & a spir. gift)
   2. *objective:* substratum (of cognition), piece, constituent (= khandha), constitution; phenomenon, thing “world,” cosmic order (as the expression of cosmic sense, as under a & 2). Thus applied to the khandhas vedanādayo tayo kh. Dhp\-a.i.35 (see *Khandha* B 3); to rūpa vedanā saññā sankhārā viññāna SN.iii.39; = sankhārā DN.iii.58, DN.iii.77, DN.iii.141. Freq. in formula *sabbe dhammā aniccā* (\+ dukkhā anattā: see *[nicca](nicca.md)*) “the whole of the visible world, all phenomena are evanescent etc.” SN.iii.132 sq. & passim.; *diṭṭhe* [va] *dhamme* in the phenomenal world (opp. samparāyika dh. the world beyond): see under *[diṭṭha](diṭṭha.md)* (SN.iv.175, SN.iv.205 etc.)  
      ■ ye dhammā hetuppabhavā tesaṃ hetuṃ Tathāgato āha “of all phenomena sprung from a cause the Buddha the cause hath told” Vin.i.40 (cp. Isā Upanishad 14). *lokadhammā* things of this world (viz. gain, fame happiness etc., see under *[lābha](lābha.md)*) DN.iii.260; Cnd.55. *uttari\-manussa\-dh˚ā* transcendental, supernormal phenomena DN.i.211, cp. DN.iii.4; abbhuta\-dh˚ā wonderful signs, portents Mil.8 (tayo acchariyā a. dh. pāturahesuṃ); Pv\-a.2: hassa\-khiḍḍhā\-rati\-dh  
      ■ samāpanna endowed with the qualities or things of mirth, play enjoyment DN.i.19; DN.iii.31; gāma˚ things or doings of the village DN.i.4 (cp. DN\-a.i.72).

2. *Ratio\-ethically*\-
   1. *objective:* “rationality,” anything that is as it should be according to its reason & logicality (as expressed under No. 1 a), i.e. right property, sound condition, norm, propriety, constitution as conforming to No. 1 in universal application i.e. *Natural or Cosmic Law:* yattha nāmañ ca rūpaṃ ca asesam uparujjhati, taṃ te dhammaṃ idhâññāya acchiduṃ bhavabandhanaṃ (recognising this law) SN.i.35 cittacetasikā dh˚ ā a term for the four mental khandhas, and gradually superseding them Dhs.1022 (cf.

### C. *The* Dhamma ###

i.e. moral philosophy, wisdom truth as propounded by Gotama Buddha in his discourses & conversations, collected by the compilers of the 5 Nikāyas (dhamma\-vinayaṃ sangāyantehi dhammasangāhakehi ekato katvā Vv\-a.3; cp. mayaṃ dh.˚ṃ ca vinayañ ca sangāyāma Vin.ii.285), resting on the deeper meaning of dhamma as explained under B 1 a, & being in short the “doctrinal” portions of the Buddhist Tipiṭaka in contradiction to the Vinaya, the portion expounding the rules of the Order (see *[piṭaka](piṭaka.md)*). Dhamma as doctrine is also opposed to Abhidhamma “what follows on the Dhamma.”

1. *Dhamma and Vinaya*, “wisdom & discipline,” as now found in the 2 great Piṭakas of the B. Scriptures, the Vinaya and Suttanta Piṭaka (but the expression “Piṭako” is later. See Piṭaka). Thus bhikkhū suttantikā vinaya\-dharā dhamma kathikā, i.e. “the bhikkhus who know the Suttantas, remember the Vinaya & preach the Word of the Buddha” Vin.ii.75 (≈ Vin.i.169), cp. Vin.iv.67. Dhamma & Vinaya combd: yo ‘haṃ evaṃ svâkkhāte Dh\-vinaye pabbajito SN.i.119; bhikkhu na evarūpiṃ kathaṃ kattā hoti: na tvaṃ imaṃ Dh\-v˚ṃ ājānāsi, ahaṃ imaṃ Dh\-v˚ṃ ājānāmi etc. SN.iii.12; imaṃ Dh\-v˚ṃ na sakkomi vitthārena ācikkhituṃ SN.i.9; samaṇā… imasmiṃ Dh\-v˚e gādhanti SN.iii.59  
   ■ Thus in var. compounds (see below), as Dh\-dhara (\+ V\-dh.) one who knows both by heart Dh\-vādin (\+ V\-v.) one who can recite both, etc  
   ■ See e.g. the foll. passages: Vin.ii.285 (dh. ca v. ca pariyatta), Vin.ii.304; Vin.iii.19, Vin.iii.90; DN.i.8, DN.i.176, DN.i.229; DN.ii.124 (ayaṃ Dh. ayaṃ V. idaṃ Satthu\-sāsanaṃ); DN.iii.9, DN.iii.12, DN.iii.28, DN.iii.118 sq. SN.i.9, SN.i.119, SN.i.157; SN.ii.21, SN.ii.50, (dh\-vinaye assāsa); AN.iii.297 (id.); SN.ii.120; SN.iii.91; SN.iv.43 sq., SN.iv.260; AN.i.34, AN.i.121, AN.i.185 AN.i.266; AN.ii.2, AN.ii.26, AN.ii.117, AN.ii.168; AN.iii.8, AN.iii.168 sq.; AN.iv.36, AN.iv.200 sq. AN.v.144, AN.v.163, AN.v.192; Iti.112; Snp.p.102; Ud.50.
2. *Dhamma, Buddha, Sangha.* On the principle explained in Note on B 1 a rests the separation of the personality of the teacher from that which he taught (the “Doctrine,” the “Word,” the Wisdom or Truth, cp Dhamma\-kāyo Tathāgatassa adhivacanaṃ DN.iii.84) A person becoming a follower of the B. would conform to his teaching (Dh.) & to the community (“Church” Sangha) by whom his teaching was handed down. The formula of Initiation or membership is therefore threefold, viz. Buddhaṃ saraṇaṃ upemi (gacchāmi), Dhp ˚ṃ…, Sanghaṃ… i.e. I put myself into the shelter of the B., the Dh. & the S. (see further ref. under Sangha) SN.i.34 (Buddhe pasannā Dhamme ca Sanghe tibbagāravā: ete sagge pakāsenti yattha te upapajjare i.e. those who adore the B. & his Church will shine in Heaven); DN.ii.152 sq., DN.ii.202 sq., DN.ii.352; SN.iv.270 sq (˚saraṇagamana); Dhp\-a.i.206; Pv\-a.1 (vande taṃ uttamaṃ Dhp ˚ṃ, B ˚ṃ, S ˚ṃ). Cp. Satthari, Dhamme Sanghe kankhati, as 3 of the ceto\-khilā AN.iii.248≈
3. *Character of the Dhamma* in var. attributes, general phraseology  
   ■ The praise of the Dh. is expressed in many phrases, of which only a few of the more frequent can be mentioned here. Among the most famous is that of “dhammaṃ deseti ādi\- *kalyāṇaṃ* majjhe\-k˚ pariyosāna\-k˚, etc. “beautiful in the beginning, beautiful in the middle & beautiful in the end,” e.g. DN.i.62; SN.i.105; SN.iv.315; AN.ii.147, AN.ii.208; AN.iii.113 sq., AN.iii.135, AN.iii.262; DN.iii.96, DN.iii.267; Cnd.316; Iti.79; Vv\-a.87. It is welcome as a friend, beautifully told, & its blessings are immediate: *sv’ akkhāta, sandiṭṭhika, akālika, ehipassika* etc. DN.ii.93; DN.iii.5, DN.iii.39, DN.iii.45, DN.iii.102; SN.i.9, SN.i.117; SN.ii.199; SN.iv.271; AN.iii.285 etc. It is *[mahā](mahā.md)* \-dh. SN.iv.128; *ariya˚*; SN.i.30; AN.v.241, AN.v.274; Snp.783; *sammā˚*; SN.i.129. It is likened to a splendid palace on a mountain\-top Vin.i.5 = Iti.33 or to a quiet lake with sīla as its banks SN.i.169 = SN.i.183 and it is above age & decay: satan ca dhammo na jaram upeti SN.i.71. Whoever worships the Dh. finds in this worship the highest gratification: diyo loke sako putto piyo loke sako pati, tato piyatarā… dhammassa magganā SN.i.210; ye keci ariyadhamme khantiyā upetā… devakāyaṃ paripūressanti SN.i.30. Dhp ˚ṃ garukaroti DN.iii.84. Opp. Dhamme agārava AN.iii.247 AN.iii.340; AN.iv.84: the slanderers of the Dh. receive the worst punishment after death SN.i.30 (upenti Roruvaṃ ghoraṃ)\-*Var. phrases:* to find the truth (i.e. to realize intuitively the Dh.) = dh˚ṃ anubodhati DN.ii.113; SN.i.137, or vindati DN.i.110, DN.i.148. To expound the Dh., teach the truth, talk about problems of ethics & philosophy dh˚ṃ deseti Vin.iv.134; SN.i.210 etc.; katheti Pv\-a.41 bhāsati Vin.i.101; bhaṇati Vin.i.169; pakāseti SN.ii.28 SN.iv.121. To hear the Dh., to listen to such an exposition: dh˚ṃ suṇāti SN.i.114, SN.i.137, SN.i.196, SN.i.210; AN.i.36; AN.iii.163; Dhp\-a.iii.81, Dhp\-a.iii.113. To attain full knowledge of it: dh ˚ṃ pariyāpuṇāti AN.ii.103, AN.ii.185; AN.iii.86, cp. AN.iii.177 & ˚pariyatti. To remember the Dh.: dhāreti AN.iii.176 (for details of the 5 stages of the Dh  
   ■ accomplishment); to ponder over the Dh., to study it: dh ˚ṃ viciṇāti SN.i.34 = SN.i.55, SN.i.214; AN.iv.3 sq.
