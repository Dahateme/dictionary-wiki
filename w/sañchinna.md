Vin.i.255 (of the kaṭhina, with samaṇḍalīkata “hemmed”). Also in cpd. *\-patta* “with leaves destroyed” is Nd ii.reading at Snp.44 (where T. ed. & Snp\-a.91 read; *[saṃsīna](saṃsīna.md)*), as well as at Snp.64 (in similar context, where T. ed. reads *[sañchinna](sañchinna.md)*). The latter passage is explained (Cnd.625) as “bahula\-pattapalāsa saṇḍa\-cchāya,” i.e. having thick & dense foliage The same meaning is attached to; *sañchinna\-patta* at Vv\-a.288 (with variant reading *[saṃsīna](saṃsīna.md)* !), thus evidently in sense of *[sañchanna](sañchanna.md)*. The C. on Snp.64 (viz. Snp\-a.117) takes it as *[sañchanna](sañchanna.md)* in introductory story.
