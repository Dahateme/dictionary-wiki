Arahatta1

neuter the state or condition of an Arahant, i.e. perfection in the Buddhist sense = Nibbāna (SN.iv.151) final & absolute emancipation Arahantship, the attainment of the last & highest stage of the Path (see *[magga](magga.md)* & anāgāmin). This is not restricted by age or sex or calling. There is one instance in the Canon of a child having attained Arahantship at the age of 7. One or two others occur in the Comy Thag\-a.64 (Selā) Pv\-a.53 (Sankicca). Many women Arahants are mentioned by name in the oldest texts. About 400 men Arahants are known. Most of them were bhikkhus, but AN.iii.451 gives the names of more than a score lay Arahants (cp DN.ii.93 = SN.v.360, and the references in *Dial.* iii.5 n4). Arahattaṃ is defined at SN.iv.252 as rāga\-kkhaya, dosa˚ moha˚. Descriptions of this state are to be found in the formulae expressing the feelings of an Arahant (see *[arahant](arahant.md)* ii.).
