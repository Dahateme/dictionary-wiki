indeclinable emphatic particle, as prefix only in *[pidahati](pidahati.md)* and *[pilandhati](pilandhati.md)* where api˚ also is found (cp. api 1b).

2. even, just so; with numbers or num. expressions “altogether, in all, just that many” Ja.i.151; Ja.iii.275; Ja.iv.142  
   ■ cattāro pi Ja.iii.51; ubho pi Ja.i.223; sabbe pi Snp.52; Ja.i.280.
3. but, however, on the other hand, now (continuing a story) Ja.i.208; Ja.iv.2.
4. although, even if Ja.ii.110 (ciram pi kho… ca although for a long time… yet).
5. perhaps, it is time that, probably Snp.43; Ja.i.151; Ja.ii.103.
6. *pi… pi* in correlation (like *api… api*):
   1. both… and; very often untranslatable Snp.681 (yadā pi… tadā pi when… then), Snp.808 (diṭṭhā pi sutā pi); Ja.i.222 (jale pi thale pi)
