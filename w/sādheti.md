6. to collect or clear a debt, to recover (money). In this sense *[sādheti](sādheti.md)* is mixed up with *[sodheti](sodheti.md)*, which is regularly found as variant reading, is it almost better to substitute *[sodheti](sodheti.md)* at all passages for *[sādheti](sādheti.md)* (cp. iṇa, uddhāra), e.g. Ja.i.230; Ja.ii.341, Ja.ii.423; Ja.iii.106 Ja.iv.45; Dhp\-a.iii.12

■ Cp. *abhi˚*.

Caus. of *sādh* to succeed. Dhtp.421 = saṃsiddhiyan
