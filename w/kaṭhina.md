*kaṭhina*

neuter a framework (covered with a mat) to which the cloth for making robes was attached while being sewn; esp. *kaṭhinaṃ attharati*

1. spreads or covers the *kaṭhina*, i.e. makes a robe using the *kaṭhina*.
2. participates, at the end of the rains\-residence, in a communal robe\-making, during which certain rules and practices are suspended (perhaps in order to facilitate the robe making); this involves: a) a *saṅghakamma* allotting the material (and the use of the *kaṭhina*) to a *bhikkhu* according to need and seniority; b) the preparation of the robe, by all the participating *bhikkhus*, from washing the cloth to adding the *kappabindu* the approval of the robe by one or more *bhikkhus* . Only those can take part and share the privileges who have spent the earlier rain\-retreat within that *sīmā* and have participated in the *pavāranā* ceremony. A minimum of five *bhikkhus* is required, but unqualified ones may make up the number without sharing the privileges. The donor gives cloth, sewing materials and food to the participating *bhikkhus* . The whole process must be completed in one day.
3. displays the finished robe.

kaṭhinaṃ attharataṃ1

neuter

1. As well as referring to the literal covering of the *kaṭhina* and the proper carrying\-out of the communal robe making, also describes a state existing in an *āvāsa* where qualified *bhikkhu* have a claim on material given to the *saṅgha* (and on the use of the *kaṭhina*) and enjoy the five concessions or privileges; at the end of five months (or earlier by decision of the *saṅgha*) this special state is ended (*kaṭhinam uddhariyati*, the *kaṭhina* is removed or put away, *ubbhataṃ*); the claims and privileges of individual *bhikkhus* end at this time, or before, if they leave the āvāsa, not intending to return.
2. the *kaṭhina* robemaking and ritual; (the materials for) the *kaṭhina* ceremony.
