There is no difference in meaning between osadha and osadhī; both mean equally any medicine whether of herbs or other ingredients. Cp. e.g. AN.iv.100 (bījagāma\-bhūtagāmā… osadhi\-tiṇavanappatayo) Pv.ii.6#10 with Snp.296 (gāvo… yāsu jāyanti osadhā); DN.i.12, cp DN\-a.i.98; Pv.iii.5#3; Pv\-a.86; Ja.iv.31; Ja.vi.331 (? trsln. medicinal *herb*). Figuratively, ʻbalm of salvation’ (amatosadha) Mil.247. Osadhi\-tārakā, star of healing. The only thing we know about this star is its white brilliance, SN.i.65; Iti.20 = AN.v.62; Vv.9#2; Pv.ii.1#10; cp. Pv\-a.71 Vism.412. Childers calls it Venus, but gives no evidence other translators render it ʻmorning star’. According to Hindu mythology the lord of medicine is the moon (oṣadhīśa), not any particular star.
