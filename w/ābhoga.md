summary = "ideation idea, thought DN.i.37 (= manasikāro saman"
```

ideation idea, thought DN.i.37 (= manasikāro samannāhāro DN\-a.i.122; cp. semantically āhāra = ābhoga, food); Vb.320; Mil.97; Vism.164, Vism.325, Vism.354; Dāvs 62; Kp\-a.42 (˚paccavekkhana), Kp\-a.43 (id.) Kp\-a.68

fr. ābhuñjati, *bhuj2* to enjoy etc. The translators of Kvu derive it from *bhuj1* to bend etc. (*Kvu trsl.* 221 n. 4) which however is hardly correct, cp. the similar meaning of gocara “pasturing”, fig. perception etc.
