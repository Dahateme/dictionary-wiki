adjective intelligent, prudent, judicicus, in *a˚*; Dpvs.ix.17, foolish, imprudent, unmindful of their own interest (translation suggested by E. Hardy as preferable to Oldenberg’s “unnoticed”). Morris, *J.P.T.S.* 1893 69 suggests “not fighting,” thus making abujjhaka avujjh˚ = ayujjh˚ (of *yudh*).

fr. *budh*
