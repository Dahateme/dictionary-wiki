1. the bile, gall; the bile also as seat of the bilious temperament, excitement or anger. Two kinds are distinguished at Kp\-a.60 Vism.260, viz. *baddha˚ & abaddha˚;*, bile as organ bile as fluid. See also in detail Vism.359; Vb\-a.65 Vb\-a.243  
   ■ In enumerations of the parts or affections of the body pitta is as a rule combined with *[semha](semha.md)* (cp Vin.ii.137; Kp.111; Vism.260, Vism.344; Mil.298)  
   ■ Vin.ii.137; MN.iii.90; SN.iv.230, SN.iv.231 (\+ semha); AN.ii.87 AN.iii.101, AN.iii.131; Snp.198 (\+ semha), Snp.434 (id., explained as the two kinds at Snp\-a.388); Mnd.370; Ja.i.146 (\+ semha), Ja.ii.114 (pittan te kupitaṃ your bile is upset or out of order, i.e. you are in a bad mood); Mil.112 (vāta\-pittasemha…), Mil.304 (roga, \+ semha), Mil.382 (\+ semha) Dhs\-a.190 (as blue\-green); Dhp\-a.iii.15 (cittaṃ n’ atthi pittaṃ n’ atthi has no heart and no bile, i.e. does not feel & get excited; vv.ll. vitta & nimitta).
2. [according to Morris, *J.P.T.S.* 1893, 4 for \*phitta = phīta Sk. sphīta] swelling, a gathering Vin.ii.188 (*Vin. Texts* iii.237 “a burst gall, i.e. bladder”); SN.ii.242. The passage is not clear, in C. on Ud.i.7 we read cittaṃ, see Morris loc. cit. May the meaning be “muzzle”?

* *\-[kosaka](kosaka.md)* gall\-bladder Kp\-a.61; Vism.263; Vb\-a.246.
