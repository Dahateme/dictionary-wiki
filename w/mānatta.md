sort of penance, attached to the commission of a sanghādisesa offence Dhs\-a.399 (\+ parivāsa). *\-ṃ deti* to inflict penance on somebody Vin.ii.7 (\+ parivāsaṃ deti); Vin.iv.225. *mānatt’ āraha* deserving penance Vin.ii.55, Vin.ii.162 (parivāsika \+). See on term *Vin. Texts* ii.397.

a doubtful word, prob. corrupted out of something else, maybe omānatta, if taken as der. fr māna1. If however taken as belonging to māna2 as an abstr. der., it might be explained as “measuring, taking measures,” which suits the context better. The BSk form is still more puzzling, viz. mānāpya “something pleasant”: Mpt § 265
