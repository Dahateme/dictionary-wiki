1. to think, to be of opinion, to imagine, to deem Snp.199 (sīsaṃ… subhato naṃ maññati bālo), Snp.588 (yena yena hi maññanti, tato taṃ hoti aññathā) Ja.ii.258 (maññāmi ciraṃ carissati: I imagine he will have to wander a long time)  
   ■ With (double) acc.: to take for, to consider as; na taṃ maññāmi mānusiṃ I deem you are not human Pv.ii.4#1; yassa dāni *kālaṃ maññati* for this now may he think it time (in a phrase of departure), let him do what he thinks fit, we wait the Buddha’s pleasure, i.e. let it be time to go [so also BSk. manyate kālaṃ, e.g. Divy.50, Divy.64 etc.] DN.i.189. Esp. in phrase *taṃ kiṃ maññasi* (maññatha 2 pl.) what do you think of this? (the foll.), what is your opinion about this? DN.i.60; SN.iii.104 & passim  
   pot 1st sg *maññeyyaṃ* I should think Pv\-a.40; 3rd sg. *maññeyya* SN.iii.103, and *[maññe](maññe.md)* Snp.206. The short form 1st sg *[maññe](maññe.md)* is used like an adv. as affirmative particle is inserted without influencing the grammatical or syntactical construction of the sentence; meaning methinks, for certain, surely, indeed, I guess, presumably. E.g. DN.i.137 (patapati m. paccatthike yasasā); SN.i.181 (m. ‘haṃ); SN.iv.289 (paveliyamānena m kāyena); Ja.ii.275; Mil.21; Vism.90, Vism.92 (mato me m putto); Dhp\-a.i.107; Dhp\-a.ii.51; Pv\-a.40 (m. goṇo samuṭṭhahe), Pv\-a.65 (tasmā m. sumuttā)  
   ■ *na maññe* surely not Dhp\-a.ii.84; Pv\-a.75 (n. m. puññavā rājā).
2. to know, to be convinced, to be sure Snp.840 (= jānāti Mnd.192), Snp.1049, Snp.1142; Cnd.491 (= jānāti); Dhp\-a.i.29 (maññāmi tuvaṃ marissasi).
3. to imagine, to be proud (of) to be conceited, to boast Snp.382 (ppr. maññamāna), Snp.806, Snp.813, Snp.855 (maññate); Ja.iii.530 (aor. maññi ‘haṃ perhaps maññe ‘haṃ? C. explains by maññāmi)  
   pp *[mata](mata.md)*  
   ■ *Note.* Another Present form is *[munāti](munāti.md)* (q.v.) of which the pp. is *[muta](muta.md)*.

*man*, Vedic manyate & manute, Av. mainyeite; Idg. *\*men*, cp. Gr. μένος mood, anger = Sk. manah mind; μέμονα to think of, wish to, Lat. memini to think of, mens → mind, meneo; Goth. munan to think muns opinion; Oisl. man, Ags. mon; Ohg. minna love Ags, myne intention. Dhtp.427: *man* = ñāṇe, 524 bodhane
