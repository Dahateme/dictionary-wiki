certain office or occupation at court connected with music or other entertainment, a bard. With other terms in list at Mil.331, some of them obscure and regional. Also at Ja.vi.277, where explained as “vetālā [read vettāya? uṭṭhāpake,” i.e. those whose duty it is [by vetāla or vetta] to make (people] rise. The expln is obscure, the *uṭṭhāpaka* reminds of Bdhgh’s *uṭṭhāpana* (under vetāla). Kern misunderstands the phrase by translating “chasing bards away.”
