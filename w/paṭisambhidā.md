lit. “resolving continuous breaking up,” i.e. analysis, analytic insight discriminating knowledge. See full discussion expln of term at Kvu translation 377–⁠382. Always referred to as “the four branches of logical analysis” (catasso or catupaṭisambhidā), viz. *attha˚*; analysis of meanings “in extension”; *dhamma˚*; of reasons, conditions, or causal relations; *nirutti˚*; of [meanings “in intension as given in] definitions paṭibhāna˚ or intellect to which things knowable by the foregoing processes are presented (after Kvu translation). In detail at AN.ii.160; AN.iii.113 AN.iii.120; Pts.i.88, Pts.i.119; Pts.ii.150, Pts.ii.157, Pts.ii.185, Pts.ii.193; Vb.293–Vb.305 Vb\-a.386 sq. (cp. Vism.440 sq.), Vb\-a.391 sq  
■ See further AN.i.22; AN.iv.31; Cnd.386 under paṭibhānavant; Pts.i.84 Pts.i.132, Pts.i.134; Pts.ii.32, Pts.ii.56, Pts.ii.116, Pts.ii.189; Mil.22 (attha\-dh˚nirutti\-paṭibhāna\-pāramippatta), Mil.359; Vv\-a.2; Dhp\-a.iv.70 (catūsu p\-˚ āsu cheka). *p˚\-patta* one who has attained mastership in analysis AN.i.24; AN.iii.120; Pts.ii.202

paṭi \+ saṃ \+ *bhid*; the BSk. pratisaṃvid is a new formation resting on confusion between *bhid & vid;*, favoured by use & meaning of latter root in P paṭisaṃvidita. In BSk. we find pratisaṃvid in same application as in P., viz. as fourfold artha˚ dharma nirukti˚ pratibhāna˚ (?). Mvu.iii.321
