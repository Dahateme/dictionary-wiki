```

adverb opposite reciprocally, contrary Snp.825, Snp.882 (taken by Mnd.163 Mnd.290, on both passages identically, as n. pl. of adj. instead of adv., & expld by “dve janā dve kalaha\-kāraka” etc.).

* *\-[bheda](bheda.md)* [evidently in meaning of *mitta*\-bheda “break of friendship,” although *mithu* means “adversary”, thus perhaps “breaking, so as to cause opposition”] breaking of alliance, enmity DN.ii.76; Ja.iv.184 (here with variant reading mitta˚); Kv.314.

cp. Vedic mithū & P. micchā; *mith*, cp. mithaḥ alternately, Av. miχō wrongly; Goth. misso one another, missa\-leiks different; Ger. E. prefix mis\-i.e. wrongly: Ger. missetat wrong doing = misdeed; Lat mūto to change, mutuus reciprocal; Goth. maipms present = Ags. mapum; *mith* in Vedic Sk. is “to be opposed to each other,” whereas in Vedic mithuna the notion of “pair” prevails.
