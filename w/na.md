```

Na1

expletive\-emphatic particle, often used in comparative\-indefinite sense just so, like this, as if, as (see *[cana](cana.md)* & canaṃ) Ja.v.339 (Com. cttha na\-kāro upamāne). Also as *naṃ* (cp. cana → canaṃ) Vin.ii.81, Vin.ii.186 (kathaṃ naṃ = kathaṃ nu); Ja.ii.416; Ja.v.302; Ja.vi.213 (Com. p. 216: ettha eko na\-karo pucchanattho hoti); Thag.1204; Mil.177. Perhaps at Snp.148 (kattha\-ci naṃ, variant reading BB na; but Com. Kp\-a.247 etaṃ). To this na belongs na3; see also *[nu](nu.md)* & nanu.

Sk. na (in cana) & nā (in nānā, vi\-nā) Idg. pron. base \*no, cp. Gr.; νή, ναί; Lat. nē, nae surely, also encl. in ego\-ne & in question utruṃne, nam; fuller form \*eno as in Sk. anā (adv.) anena, anayā (instr. pron. 3rd) Gr. ε ̓́νη “that day”; Lat. enim

Na2

negātive & adversative particle “not” (Cnd.326: paṭikkhepa; Kp\-a.170 paṭisedhe)

1. often apostr. n’: n’ atthi, n’ etaṃ etc.; or contracted: nāhaṃ, nāpi etc., or with cuphonic consonant y: nayidaṃ (Iti.29, Ja.iv.3), nayidha (Iti.36, Iti.37) nayimaṃ (Iti.15) etc. As double negation implying emphatic affirmation: na kiñci na all, everything Ja.i.295.
2. In disjunctive clauses: *na… na* neither\-nor, so\-or not so. In question: karoti na karoti (“or not”) Ja.ii.133. Cp. *[mā](mā.md)* in same use. Often with added *[pi](pi.md)* (api) in second part: *na\-nāpi* neither\-nor (“not\-but also not”) SN.ii.65; MN.i.246; Pv.i.11#9.
3. In syntactic context mostly emphasized by var. negative & adversative particles, viz.; *nāpi* (see under 2); *n’ eva* indeed not, not for all that Ja.iii.55; or not Kp\-a.219; *n’ eva\-na* neither\-nor DN.i.33, DN.i.35; MN.i.486; AN.v.193; Ja.i.207, Ja.i.279; Vin.ii.185; Dhp\-a.i.328; Dhp\-a.ii.65; DN\-a.i.186, DN\-a.i.188; *n’ eva\-na pana* id. DN.i.24; *na kho* not indeed Ja.ii.134; *na ca* but not (= this rather than that Ja.i.153; *na tāva* = na kho Vv.37#13; *na nu* (in quest. noune) is it not? Pv\-a.74, Pv\-a.136; *na no* surely not Snp.224 *na hi* [cp. Gr. ούξί not at all; ναίξι certainly] certainly not Dhp.5, Dhp.184; Snp.666; Kp.vii.6; *na hi jātu* id. Snp.152\-See also nu, nū, no.
4. na is also used in the function of the negative prefix a\-(an\-) in cases where the word\-negation was isolated out of a sentence negation or where a negated verb was substantified, e.g. (a) nacira (= acira) short, napparūpa abundant, napuṃsaka neuter, neka (= aneka) several; (b) natthi, natthika etc. (q.v.).

Ved. na = Idg. \*ně; Lat. ne in n’ unquam etc., Goth. ni; Sk. na ca = Lat. neque = Goth. nih. Also Sk. nā Idg. \*nē, cp. Lat. Goth. nē
