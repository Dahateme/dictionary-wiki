fulfilled accomplished; (or:) lived, spent (= vuttha); only in phrase *vusitaṃ brahmacariyaṃ* (translation *Dial.* i.93; “the higher life has been fulfilled”) DN.i.84 (cp. Dhp.i.225 vutthaṃ parivutthaṃ); Iti.115 (ed. vūsita˚); Snp.463 Snp.493; Pp.61  
■ Also at DN.i.90 neg. a˚, with ref. to *avusitavā*, where Rh. D. (*Dial.* i.112) trsls “ill\-bred and “rude,” hardly just. See also *[arahant](arahant.md)* ii.A.

 s. v. vasati takes it as vi \+ uṣita (of *vas2*), against which speaks meaning of vivasati “to live from home.” Geiger,
» Pali Grammar

 § 66#1 & 195 expld it as uṣita with prothetic *v*, as by\-form of *[vuttha](vuttha.md)*. Best fitting in meaning is assumption of *[vusita](vusita.md)* being a variant of *[vosita](vosita.md)*, with change of o to u in analogy to *[vuttha](vuttha.md)*; thus = *vi \+ osita* “fulfilled, come to an end or to perfection”; cp. pariyosita. Geiger’s expln is supported by phrase *brahmacariyaṃ vasati*
