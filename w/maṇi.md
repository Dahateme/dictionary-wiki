1. a gem, jewel. At several places one may interpret as “crystal.” DN.i.7 (as ornament); Dhp.161; Ja.vi.265 (agghiya, precious). In simile at DN.i.76 (maṇi veḷuriyo). On maṇi in similes see *J.P.T.S.* 1907, 121  
   ■ *udaka\-pasādaka* maṇi a precious stone (crystal?) having the property of making water clear Mil.35 (cp. below Vism.366 passage); *cintā˚*; a “thought\-jewel,” magic stone (crystal?) Ja.iii.504; Vv\-a.32; *cūḷā˚*; a jewelled crest or diadem, the crown\-jewel Ja.v.441 sq.; *jāti˚*; a genuine precious stone Ja.ii.417; Vism.216 (in comparison); *tārā˚*; (\-vitāna) (canopy) of jewelled stars Vism.76; *nīla˚*; a dark blue jewel Ja.ii.112; Ja.iv.140; Dhp\-a.iii.254. The passage “amaṇiṃ udakaṃ maṇiṃ katvā” at Vism.366 (\+ asuvaṇṇaṃ leḍḍuṃ suvaṇṇaṃ katvā) refers clearly to meaning “jewel” (that the water is without a jewel or crystal, but is made as clear as crystal; a conjuror’s trick, cp. Mil.35). Whether meaning “waterpot” (as given at Abhp.1113 & found in der. maṇika) is referred to here, is not to be decided
2. a crystal used as burning\-glass Mil.54.
