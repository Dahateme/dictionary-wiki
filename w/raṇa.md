1. fight, battle; only in Thig.360 (raṇaṃ karitvā kāmānaṃ): see discussed below; also late at Mhvs.35, Mhvs.69 (Subharājaṃ raṇe hantvā).
2. intoxication, desire, sin, fault. This meaning is the Buddhist development of Vedic raṇa enjoyment. Various influences have played a part in determining the meaning & its expln in the scholastic terms of the dogmatists and exegetics. It is often explained as *[pāpa](pāpa.md)* or *[rāga](rāga.md)*. The Ṭīkā on Dhs\-a.50 (see *Expos.* 67) gives the foll. explains (late & speculative)
   1. = reṇu, dust or mist of lust etc.
   2. fight, war (against the Paths).
   3. pain, anguish & distress

The translation (*Expos.* 67) takes raṇa as “cause of grief,” or “harm”, hence *[araṇa](araṇa.md)* “harmless” and *[saraṇa](saraṇa.md)* “harmful” (the latter trsld as “concomitant with war” by *Dhs. trsl.* of Dhs.1294; and *[asaraṇa](asaraṇa.md)* as opp. “not concomitant” doubtful). At SN.i.148 (rūpe raṇaṃ disvā) it is almost syn. with raja. Bdhgh. explains this passage (see *K.S.* 320) as “rūpamhi jāti\-jarā\-bhanga\-sankhātaṃ dosaṃ, translation (*K.S.* 186): “discerning canker in visible objects material.”

The term is not sufficiently cleared yet. At Thig.358 we read “(kāmā) appassādā *raṇakarā* sukkapakkha\-visosanā,” and Thig.360 reads “raṇaṃ karitvā kāmānaṃ.” Thag\-a.244 explains Thig.358 by “rāg’ ādi sambandhanato”; Thig.360 by “kāmānaṃ raṇaṃ te ca mayā kātabbaṃ ariyamaggaṃ sampahāraṃ katvā.” The first is evidently “grief,” the second “fight,” but the translation (*Sisters* 145) gives “stirring strife” for Thig.358, and “fight with worldly lusts” for Thig.360; whereas Kern

 s. v. raṇakara gives “causing sinful desire” as trsl.

The word *[araṇa](araṇa.md)* (see *[araṇa](araṇa.md)*2) was regarded as neg of raṇa in both meanings (1 & 2); thus either “freedom fr. passion” or “not fighting.” The translation of Dhs\-a.50 (*Expos.* 67) takes it in a slightly diff. sense as “harmless” (i.e. having no grievous causes)  
■ At MN.iii.235 araṇa is a quâsi summing up of “adukkha an\-upaghāta anupāyāsa etc.,” and *[saraṇa](saraṇa.md)* of their positives. Here a meaning like “harmfulness” & “harmlessness” seems to be fitting. Other passages of *[araṇa](araṇa.md)* see under *[araṇa](araṇa.md)*.

* *\-[jaha](jaha.md)* (raṇañjaha) giving up desires or sin, leaving *causes* of harmfulness behind. The expression is old and stereotype. It has caused trouble among interpreters: Trenckner would like to read *raṇañjaya* “victorious in battle” (*Note.* 83). It is also Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit e.g. Lal.50;.Avs ii.131 ‣See Speyer’s note 3 on this page. He justifies translation “pacifier, peace\-maker”. At following passages: SN.i.52 (translation “quitting corruption”) Iti.108 (Seidenstücker translates: “dem Kampfgewühl entronnen”) Mil.21 Netti.54; Sdhp.493 Sdhp.569

Vedic raṇa, both “enjoyment,” and “battle.” The Dhtp (115) only knows of *ran* as a sound\-base saddatthā (= Sk. *ran2* to tinkle)
