sage, seer, wise man, usually appositionally nom. *mantā* “as a sage,” “like a thinker,” a form which looks like a *fem.* and is mostly explained as such by the Commentaries *Mantā* has also erroneously been taken as instr. of manta, or as a so\-called *ger.* of manteti, in which latter two functions it has been explained at “jānitvā.” The form has evidently puzzled the old commentators as early as the Niddesa; through the Abhp (153 979) it has come down at *mantā* “*wisdom*” to Childers Kern,

 s. v. hesitates and only comes half near the truth. The Index to Pj. marks the word with? SN.i.57 (\+ dhīra; translation “firm *in doctrine*”); Snp.159 (“in truth,” opp. to musā; Snp\-a.204 explains m. = paññā; tāya paricchinditvā bhāsati), Snp.916 (mantā asmī ti, explained at Snp\-a.562 by “mantāya”), Snp.1040 = Snp.1042 (= Cnd.497 mantā vuccati paññā etc.); Vv.63#6 (explained as jānitvā paññāya paricchinditvā Vv\-a.262)  
■ Besides this form we have a shortened *[manta](manta.md)* (nom.) at Snp.455 (akiñcano \+), which is explained at Snp\-a.402 as *mantā jānitvā* It is to be noted that for *manta\-bhāṇin* at Snp.850 the Mnd.219 reads *mantā* and explains customarily by “mantāya pariggahetvā vācaṃ bhāsati.”
