is frequent variant reading for *cāṭu\-kamyatā*, which is probably the correct reading (see this). The meaning (according to Vism.27 = Vb\-a.483) is “putting oneself low,” i.e. flattery, “fawning” (*Vism trsl.* 32). A still more explicit defn is found at Vb\-a.338. The diff spellings are as follows: *[cāṭukamyatā](cāṭukamyatā.md)* Vism.17, Vism.27 Kp\-a.236; Vb\-a.338, Vb\-a.483; *cāṭukammatā* Mil.370 *[pāṭukamyatā](pāṭukamyatā.md)* Vb.246; *[pātukamyatā](pātukamyatā.md)* Cnd.39. See standing phrase under mugga\-sūpyatā.
