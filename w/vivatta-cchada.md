Vivatta\-cchada

adjective having the cover removed, with the veil lifted; one who draws away the veil (cp. vivaraṇa or reveals (the Universe etc.); or one who is freed of all (mental & spiritual) coverings (thus Bdhgh), epithet of the Buddha  
■ Spelling sometimes; *chadda˚*; (see *[chada](chada.md)*)\-DN.i.89; DN.ii.16; DN.iii.142 (dd; sammā\-sambuddha loke vivatta\-chadda; translation “rolling back the veil from the world”), DN.iii.177 (dd); AN.ii.44 (variant reading dd); Snp.372 (explained as “vivaṭa\-rāga\-dosa\-moha\-chadana Snp\-a.365), Snp.378, Snp.1003 (ed. Snp p.efers dd as T. reading); Cnd.593 (with allegorical interpretation); Ja.i.51; Ja.iii.349; Ja.iv.271 (dd) Dhp\-a.i.201 (variant reading dd); Dhp\-a.iii.195; DN\-a.i.250  
■ It occurs either as *vivatta˚*; or *vivaṭa˚*. In the first case (*vivatta˚*; the expln presents difficulties, as it is neither the opp of *[vatta](vatta.md)* (“duty”), nor the same as *[vivaṭṭa](vivaṭṭa.md)* (“moving back” intrs.), nor a direct pp. of *[vivattati](vivattati.md)* (like Sk vivṛtta) in which meaning it would come nearer to “stopped, reverted, ceased.” *[vivattati](vivattati.md)* has not been found in Pāli. The only plausible expln would be taking it as an abs. pp. formation fr. *vṛt* in Caus. sense (vatteti) thus “moved back, stopped, discarded”, in meaning “uncovered, lifted, off,” referring to the covering (chada) as uncovered instead of the uncovered object. See *[vivaṭa](vivaṭa.md)*. It is difficult to decide between the two meanings. On the principle of the “lectio difficilior” *vivatta* would have the preference whereas from a natural & simple point of view; *[vivaṭa](vivaṭa.md)* seems more intelligible & more fitting. It is evidently an; *old* phrase. *Note.* *\-vivatta\-kkhandha* at SN.i.121 is a curious expression (“with his shoulders twisted round”?). Is it an old misreading for *pattakkhandha?* Cp. however, S.A. quoted *K.S.* i.151 n. 5, explaining it as a dying monk’s effort to gain an orthodox posture.

cp. BSk vivartayati to cast off a garment, Divy.39). In the second case (*vivaṭa˚*;) it is pp. of *[vivarati](vivarati.md)* [vi \+ *vṛ*: see *vuṇāti*
