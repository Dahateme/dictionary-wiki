1. duty, occupation, activity Snp.158 (khīṇa of the Arahant: having no more duties, cp. vyappathi)
2. way of speaking, speech, utterance Snp.163, Snp.164 (contrasted to citta & kamma; cp. kāya, vācā, mano in same use), explained at Snp\-a.206 by *[vacīkamma](vacīkamma.md)*; & in defn of “speech” at Vin.iv.2 (see under *[byappatha](byappatha.md)*) Dhs\-a.324 (explained as vākya\-bheda).

perhaps a distortion of \*vyāpṛta, for which the usual P. (der.) *[veyyāvacca](veyyāvacca.md)* (q.v.) in meaning “duty”
