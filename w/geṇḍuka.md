ball for playing. The SS spelling is in all places *[bheṇḍuka](bheṇḍuka.md)*, which has been taken into the text by the editors of J. and Dhs\-a. The misspelling is due to a misreading of Singhalese bh → g; cp. spelling parābhetvā for parāgetvā  
■ bheṇḍukena kīḷi Ja.iv.30 bhūmiyaṃ pahata\-bheṇḍuka (striking against the ground) Ja.iv.30; Vism.143 (pahaṭa\-citra˚) = Dhs\-a.116 (where wrongly pahaṭṭha\-citta\-bheṇḍuka); Ja.v.196 (citra\-bh˚); Dhp\-a.iii.364.
