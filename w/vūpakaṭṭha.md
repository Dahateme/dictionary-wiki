alienated, withdrawn, drawn away (from), secluded often in phrase *eko vūpakaṭṭho appamatto ātāpī* etc (see *[arahant](arahant.md)* ii.B.), e.g. DN.iii.76; SN.i.117; SN.ii.21, SN.ii.244 SN.iii.35, SN.iii.73 sq.; SN.iv.72; AN.iv.299. Cp. also AN.iv.435 (gaṇasmā v.).

doubtful, whether *vi \+ upakaṭṭha* (since the latter is only used of *time*), or = *[vavakaṭṭha](vavakaṭṭha.md)*, with which it is identical in meaning. Cp. also BSk. vyapakṛṣṭa Avs.i.233; Avs.ii.194; of which it might be a re\-translation.
