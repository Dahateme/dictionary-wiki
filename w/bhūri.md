Bhūri1

feminine the earth; given as name for the earth (paṭhavi) at Pts.ii.197; see also def. at Dhs\-a.147. Besides these only in 2 doubtful compounds, both resting on demonology, viz. *bhūrikamma* DN.i.12, explained as “practices to be observed by one living in a bhūrighara or earth\-house” (?) DN\-a.i.97, but cp. Vedic bhūri\-karman “much effecting”; and *bhūrivijjā* DN.i.9, explained as “knowledge of charms to be pronounced by one living in an earth\-house” (?) DN\-a.i.93. See *Dial.* i.18, i.25. The meaning of the terms is obscure there may have been (as Kern rightly suggests: see
» Toevoegselen

 s. v.) quite a diff. popular practice behind them which was unknown to the later Commentator. Kern suggests that *bhūri\-vijjā* might be a secret science to find gold (digging for it: science of hidden treasures) and *\-kamma* might be “making gold” (alchemistic science). Perhaps the term *bhumma\-jāla* is to be connected with these two.
