Accharā1

feminine the snapping of the fingers, the bringing together of the finger\-tips:

1. (lit.) *accharaṃ paharati* to snap the fingers Ja.ii.447; Ja.iii.191; Ja.iv.124, Ja.iv.126 Ja.v.314; Ja.vi.366; Dhp\-a.i.38, Dhp\-a.i.424  
   ■ As measure: as much as one may hold with the finger\-tips, a pinch Ja.v.385; Dhp\-a.ii.273 (˚gahaṇamattaṃ); cp. ekacchara\-matta Dhp\-a.ii.274.
2. (fig.) a finger’s snap, i.e. a short moment in *ek˚acchara\-kkhaṇe* in one moment Mil.102, and in def. of acchariya (q.v.) at DN\-a.i.43; Vv\-a.329.

* *\-[saṅghāta](saṅghāta.md)* the snapping of the fingers as signifying a short duration of time, a moment, *˚matta* momentary only for one moment (cp. BSk. acchaṭāsanghāta Divy.142) AN.i.10, AN.i.34, AN.i.38; AN.iv.396; Thag.405; Thag.2, Thag.67 (expld at Thag\-a.76 as ghaṭikāmattam pi khaṇaṃ angulipoṭhanamattam pi kālaṃ).
* *\-[sadda](sadda.md)* the sound of the snapping of a finger Ja.iii.127.

etym. uncertain, but certainly dialectical; Trenckner connects it with ācchurita (Notes 76); Childers compares Sk. akṣara (see *[akkhara](akkhara.md)*); there may be a connection with akkhaṇa in akkhaṇa\-vedhin (cp. BSk. acchaṭā Divy.555), or possibly a relation to ā \+ *tsar*, thus meaning “stealthily”, although the primary meaning is “snapping, a quick sound”
