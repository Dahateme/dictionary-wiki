1. The Vedic god Indra DN.i.244; DN.ii.261, DN.ii.274; Snp.310, Snp.316, Snp.679, Snp.1024; Mnd.177.

Vism.491. [Europeans have found a strange difficulty in understanding the real relation of Sakka to Indra. The few references to Indra in the Nikāyas should be classed with the other fragments of Vedic mythology to be found in them. Sakka belongs only to the Buddhist mythology then being built up. He is not only quite different from Indra, but is the direct contrary of that blustering, drunken god of war. See the passages collected in *Dial.* ii.294, ii.298.] The idiom *sa\-Indā devā*, DN.ii.261, DN.ii.274; AN.v.325 means ʻthe gods about Indra, Indra’s retinue’, this being a Vedic story. But *Devā Tāvatiṃsā sahindakā* means the T. gods together with their leader (DN.ii.208–DN.ii.212; SN.iii.90; cp. Vv.30#1) this being a Buddhist story].
