to restrain, suppress, to become tranquil; only in stanza Dhp.6 = Thag.275 = Ja.iii.488 as 1st pl. med *yamāmase* in imper. sense: “pare ca na vijānanti mayaṃ ettha yamāmase,” which is explained both at Dhp\-a.i.65, Thag A, & Ja.iii.489 in connection with yama,2 viz. “yamāmase: uparamāma nassāma satataṃ samitaṃ maccu\-santikaṃ gacchāmā ti na jānanti,” i.e. let us go continually into the presence of death. A little further at Dhp\-a.i.66 the expln of it is “bhaṇḍ’ ādīnaṃ vuddhiyā *vāyamāmā* ti na vijānanti.” The meaning is “to control oneself,” cp. saṃyamāmase SN.i.209. Leop. v. Schroeder however trsls. “Und mancher Mann bedenket nicht: wir alle müssen sterben hier” (*Worte der Wahrheit*, p. 2.)  
■ *yameyyātha* at SN.i.217 is wrongly separated from the preceding vā which ought to be read as *vāyameyyātha* (so *K.S.* i.281).

*yam*, given in meaning “uparame” i.e. cessation, quieting at Dhtp.226 & Dhtm.322, at the latter with additional “nāse.” On etym. see Walde, *Lat. Wtb.* s. v. redimio and emo: cp. yanta.
