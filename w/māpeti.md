1. to build, construct SN.ii.106 (nagaraṃ); Mhvs.6, Mhvs.35 (id.); Vv.84#53; Vv\-a.260.
2. to create, bring about make or cause to appear by supernatural power (in folkoristic literature, cp. nimmināti in same sense Ja.ii.111 (sarīraṃ nāvaṃ katvā māpesi transformed into a ship); Ja.iv.274; Mhvs.28, Mhvs.31 (maggaṃ caused a road to appear).
3. to measure out (?), to declare (?), in a doubtful passage Ja.iv.302, where a misreading is probable as indicated by variant reading BB (samāpassiṃsu for T tena amāpayiṃsu). Perhaps we should read tena\-māsayiṃsu.

Caus. of *[mā](mā.md)*, see *[mināti](mināti.md)*. The simplex mimīte has the meaning of “erect, build” already in Vedic Sk.
