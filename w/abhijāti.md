1. Species. Only as t. t. in use by certain non\-Buddhist teachers. They divided mankind into six species, each named after a colour DN.i.53, DN.i.54; AN.iii.383 ff. (quoted DN\-a.i.162) gives details of each species. Two of them, the black and the white, are interpreted in a Buddhist sense at DN.iii.250, MN.ii.222 and Ne.158. This interpretation (but not the theory of the six species) has been widely adopted by subsequent Hindu writers.
2. Rebirth, descent, Mil.226.
