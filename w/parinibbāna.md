“complete Nibbāna” in two meanings:

1. complete extinction of khandhalife; i.e. all possibility of such life & its rebirth, final release from (the misery of) rebirth and transmigration death (after the last life\-span of an Arahant). This is the so\-called “an\-upādi\-sesa Parinibbāna,” or “extinction with no rebirth\-substratum left.”
2. release from cravings & attachment to life, emancipation (in this life) with the assurance of final death; freedom of spirit, calm, perfect well\-being or peace of soul. This is the so\-called “sa\-upādisesa\-P.,” or “extinction (of passion) with some substratum left.”\-The two kinds are distinguished by Bdhgh at Dhp\-a.ii.163 as follows “arahatta\-pattito paṭṭhāya kilesa\-vaṭṭassa khepitattā sa\-upādi\-sesena, carima\-citta\-nirodhena khandhavaṭṭassa khepitattā an\-upādi\-sesena cā ti dvīhi pi parinibbānehi parinibbutā, an\-upādāno viya padīpo apaṇṇattika\-bhāvaṃ gatā.”
3. DN.ii.72 sq. (the famous Mahā\-parinibbāna\-suttanta or “Book of the Great Decease”); MN.iii.127, MN.iii.128; AN.ii.79 (˚samaye), AN.iii.409 (˚dhamma, contrasted with āpāyika nerayika cp. Dhp\-a.iv.42); Mhvs.7, Mhvs.1 (˚mañcamhi nipanna); Vv\-a.158; Pv\-a.244.
4. DN.iii.55; AN.v.64; Snp.514 (˚gata vitiṇṇa\-kankho); Vv.53#24 (˚gata \+ sītibhūta). This state of final emancipation (during life) has also received the determination of anupādā\-parinibbāna, i.e. emancipation without ground. for further clinging (lit without fuel), which corresponds to Bdhgh’s term “kilesavaṭṭassa khepitattā sa\-upādi\-sesa p.” (see above) thus at MN.i.148; SN.iv.48; SN.v.29; AN.i.44; AN.v.65 (nicchāto nibbuto sītibhūto etc).; AN.v.233 = AN.v.253 = Dhp.89 (\+ khīṇāsava).
