adjective to be gained or procured with difficulty (i.e. a livelihood which is hardly procurable), only in phrase *“dubbhikkhā d setaṭṭhikā salākavuttā,”* of a famine Vin.iii.6, Vin.iii.15, Vin.iii.87 Vin.iv.23; SN.iv.323. On the term & its expln by Bdhgh (at Vin.iii.268: dujjīvikā īhī tī… dukkhena īhitaṃ ettha pavattatī ti) see Kern,

 i.122  
■ *Note.* Bdhgh’s expln is highly speculative, & leaves the problem still unsolved. The case of du1 appearing as du\-(and not as dur\-) before a vowel is most peculiar there may be a connection with *druh* (see *[duhana](duhana.md)*), which is even suggested by vv.ll. at SN.iv.223 as dūhitika duhitika (q.v.).

du\-īhitika, of du1 \+ īhati
