Vy˚

is the semi\-vowel (i.e. half\-consonantic) form of *vi˚*; before following *a & ā* (vya˚, vyā), very rarely *ū & o;* The prefix vi˚ is very unstable, and a variety of forms are also attached to vy˚, which, after the manner of all consonant\-combinations in Pāḷi, may apart from its regular form *[vy˚](vy˚.md)*; appear either as *contracted* to *vv˚*; (written *v˚*;) like vagga (for vyagga), vaya (for vyaya), vosita (= vyosita), \*vvūha (= vyūha, appearing as ˚bhūha), or *diaeretic* as *viy˚*; (in poetry) or *[veyy˚](veyy˚.md)*; (popular), e.g. viyañjana, viyārambha, viyāyata; or veyvañjanika veyyākaraṇa, veyyāyika. It further appears as *by˚* (like byaggha, byañjana, byappatha, byamha, byāpanna byābādha etc.). In a few cases *vya˚*; represents (a diaeretic) *vi˚*; as in vyamhita & vyasanna; and *vyā˚*; = vi˚ in vyārosa.
