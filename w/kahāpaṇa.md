The extant specimens in our museums weigh about 5/6 of a penny and the purchasing power of a k. in our earliest records seems to have been about a florin

■ ekaṃ k˚ pi not a single farthing Ja.i.2; similarly eka\-kahāpaṇen eva Vism.312  
■ Various qualities of a kahāpaṇa are referred to by Bdhgh in similes at Vism.437 and 515 *Black* kahāpaṇas are mentioned at Dhp\-a.iii.254  
■ See Rh. Davids, *Ancient Measures of Ceylon; Buddh. India*, pp. 100–⁠102, fig. 24; *Mil trsl.* i.239.

* *\-[vassa](vassa.md)* a shower of money Dhp.186 (= Dhp\-a.iii.240).

doubtful as regards etym.; the (later) Sk. kārṣāpaṇa looks like an adaptation of a dial. form
