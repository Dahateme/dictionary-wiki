Rasa1

that which is connected with the sense of taste. The defn given at Vism.447 is as follows “jivhā\-paṭihanana\-lakkhaṇo raso, jivhā\-viññāṇassa visaya\-bhāvo raso, tass’ eva gocara\-paccupaṭṭhāno mūla\-raso khandha\-raso ti ādinā nayena anekavidho, i.e. rasa is physiologically & psychologically peculiar to the tongue (sense\-object & sense\-perception), and also consists as a manifold object in extractions from roots, trunk etc. (see next)  
■ The conventional encyclopaedic defn of *[rasa](rasa.md)* at Mnd.240; Cnd.540, Dhs.629 gives taste according to: (a) the 6\-fold objective source as *mūla\-* rasa, *khandha˚, taca˚, patta˚, puppha˚, phala˚*; or taste (i.e. juice, liquid) of root, trunk, bark, leaf flower & fruit; and (b) the 12\-fold subjective (physiological) sense\-perception as *ambila, madhura, tittika kaṭuka loṇika, khārika, lambila* (Mil.56: ambila) *kasāva; sādu, asādu, sīta, uṇha*, or sour, sweet, bitter pungent, salt, alkaline, sour, astringent; pleasant, unpleasant cold & hot. Mil.56 has the foll.: *ambila lavaṇa, tittaka*, kaṭuka, kasāya, madhura.

1. juice [as applied in the Veda to the Soma juice], e.g. in the foll. combinations: *ucchu˚*; of sugar cane, extract of sugar cane syrup Vin.i.246; Vv\-a.180; *patta˚ & puppha˚;* of leaf & flower Vin.i.246; *madhura˚*; of honey Pv\-a.119
2. taste as (objective) quality, the sense\-object of taste (cp. above defns). In the list of the *āyatanas* or senses with their complementary sense\-objects (sentient and sensed) *[rasa](rasa.md)* occupies the 4th place following upon *[gandha](gandha.md)*. It is stated that one tastes (or “senses”) taste with the tongue (no reference to palate) *jivhāya rasaṃ sāyitvā* (or *[viññeyya](viññeyya.md)*). See also *[āyatana](āyatana.md)* 3 and rūpa  
   ■ MN.iii.55 (jivhā\-viññeyya r.), MN.iii.267; DN.iii.244, DN.iii.250; Snp.387; Dhs.609; Pv\-a.50 (vaṇṇagandha\-rasa\-sampanna bhojana: see below 5).
3. sense of taste, as quality & personal accomplishment. Thus in the list of senses marking superiority (the 10 ādhipateyyas or ṭhāṇas), similar to rasa as special distinction of the Mahāpurisa (see cpd. ras\-agga) SN.iv.275 = Pv.ii.9#58; AN.iv.242.
4. object or act of enjoyment, sensual stimulus, material enjoyment, pleasure (usually in pl.) Snp.65 (rasesu gedha, see materialistic exegesis at Cnd.540), Snp.854 (rase na anugijjhati; perhaps better *rasesu*, as Snp\-a); AN.iii.237 (puriso agga˚\-parititto perhaps to No. 2).
5. flavour and its substance (or substratum), e.g. soup Vv\-a.243 (kakkaṭaka˚ crabsoup), cp. SN.v.149, where 8 soup flavours are given (ambila, tittaka, kaṭuka, madhura, khārika, akhārika loṇika, aloṇika); Pv.ii.1#15 (aneka\-rasa\-vyañjana “with exceptionally flavoured sauce”); Ja.v.459, Ja.v.465. *gorasa* “flavour of cow, i.e. produce of cow: see under *[go](go.md)*. Also metaphorically: “flavour, relish, pleasure” Snp.257 (pariveka˚, dhamma\-pīṭi˚, cp. Snp\-a.299 “assād aṭṭhena” i.e. tastiness); Pv\-a.287 (vimutti˚ relish of salvation). So also as *attha˚, dhamma˚, vimutti˚* Pts.ii.89.
6. (in grammar & style) essential property, elegance, brightness; in dramatic art “sentiment (flavour) (see Childers s. v. naṭya\-rasa) Mil.340 (with opamma and lakkhaṇa: perhaps to No. 7); Pv\-a.122 (˚rasa as ending in Np. Angīrasa, explained as jutiyā adhivacanaṃ” i.e. brightness, excellency).
7. at t. t. in philosophy “essential property” (*Expos.* 84), combined with *[lakkhaṇa](lakkhaṇa.md)* etc. (cp. *Cpd.* 13, 213), either *kicca˚* function or *sampatti˚*; property Dhs\-a.63, Dhs\-a.249; Vism.8 Vism.448; Mil.148.
8. fine substance, semi\-solid, semiliquid substance, extract, delicacy, fineness, dust. Thus in *paṭhavī˚*; “essence of earth,” humus SN.i.134 (translation “taste of earth,” rather abstract); or *[rasapaṭhavī](rasapaṭhavī.md)* earth as dust or in great fineness, “primitive earth” (before taking solid shape) DN.iii.86 sq. (trsl “savoury earth,” not quite clear), opp. to bhūmipappaṭaka; Vism.418; *pabbata\-rasa* mountain extract, rock\-substance Ja.iii.55; *suvaṇṇa˚*; gold dust Ja.i.93.
9. (adj. ˚) tasting Vv.16#11 (Amatarasā f. = nibbānarasāvinī Vv\-a.85).

* *\-[agga](agga.md)* finest quality (of taste), only in further compound with *˚aggita* (ras\-agga\-s\-aggita) most delicate sense translation *Dial.*) DN.iii.167, and *˚aggin* (ras\-agga\-s\-aggin, cp Mvu.ii.306: rasa\-ras’ âgrin) of the best quality (of taste, cp. above 2), said of the Mahāpurisa DN.ii.18 DN.iii.144 (cp. translation *Dial.* ii.15 “his taste is supremely acute”). The phrase & its wording are still a little doubtful. Childers gives etym. of rasaggas\-aggin as rasa\-ggas\-aggin, ggas representing; *gras* to swallow (not otherwise found in Pāli!), and explains the BSk. ras’âgrin as a distortion of the P. form.
* *\-[añjana](añjana.md)* a sort of ointment (among 5 kinds), “vitriol” (Rh. D.) Vin.i.203.
* *\-āda* enjoying the objects of taste MN.iii.168
* *\-[āyatana](āyatana.md)* the sphere of taste DN.iii.243, DN.iii.290; Dhs.629 Dhs.653, Dhs.1195 (insert after gandha˚, see *Dhs. trsl.* 319)
* *\-[ārammaṇa](ārammaṇa.md)* object of taste Dhs.12, Dhs.147, Dhs.157.
* *\-[āsā](āsā.md)* craving for tastes Dhs.1059.
* *\-[garuka](garuka.md)* bent on enjoyment Snp\-a.107.
* *\-[taṇhā](taṇhā.md)* thirst for taste, lust of sensual enjoyment DN.iii.244, DN.iii.280; Ja.v.293; Dhs.1059; Dhp\-a.iv.196.
* *\-[saññā](saññā.md)* perception of tastes DN.iii.244 (where also ˚sañcetanā).
* *\-[haraṇī](haraṇī.md)* (f.) [ph. ˚haraṇiyo, in compound haraṇi˚] taste\-conductor, taste\-receiver; the salivary canals of the mouth or the nerves of sensation; these are in later literature given as numbering 7000, e.g. at Ja.v.293 (khobhetvā phari); Dhp\-a.i.134 (anuphari) Kp\-a.51 (only as 7!); Snp\-a.107 (paṭhama\-kabaḷe mukhe pakkhitta\-matte satta rasa\-haraṇi\-sahassāni amaten eva phutāni ahesuṃ). Older passages are: Vin.ii.137; DN.iii.167 (referring to the Mahāpurisa: “sampajjasā r\-haranī susaṇṭhitā,” translation: erect taste\-bearers planted well [in throat]).

Vedic rasa; with Lat. ros “dew,” Lith. rasā id., and Av Ranhā Name of a river, to Idg. *\*eres* to flow, as in Sk. arṣati, Gr. α ̓́ψορρος (to ῥέω); also Sk. ṛṣabha: see *[usabha](usabha.md)*1  
■ Dhtp.325 defines as “*assādane*” 629 as *“assāda\-snehanesu”*; Dhtm.451 as “assāde.”\-The decl. is usually as regular a\-stem, but a secondary instr fr. an s\-stem is to be found in *rasasā* by taste AN.ii.63; Ja.iii.328

Rasa2

(\-˚) is a dial. form of *\-dasa* ten, and occurs in Classic Pāli only in the numerals for 13 (terasa), 15 (paṇṇa\-rasa, pannarasa), 17 (sattarasa) & 18 (aṭṭhārasa, late). The Prk. has gone further: see Pischel; *Prk. Gr.* § 245.
