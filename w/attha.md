attha1

m rarely neuter

1. aim, purpose, goal; advantage, profit, benefit.
2. use, need, want (\+ instr.).
3. 1. affair, concern, business; problem; thing, matter; (with verbs of saying, asking, etc. often simply) this, that.
   2. practical affairs, policy;
   3. a legal case.

4. meaning, sense; very often in commentaries at end of explained (esp. paraphrased) passages as ti attho: this is the meaning; in association with dhamma, attha expresses the goal as opposed to the doctrine; practical affairs as opposed to spiritual matters; the practical application and result as opposed to the theory; the interpretation as opposed to the text.

attha2

masculine neuter

1. sets (of the sun or moon)
2. goes out, disappears, is extinguished.

SN.i.86, SN.i.102, SN.i.126 = AN.ii.46 (atthassa patti); SN.i.162 (attano ca parassa ca); SN.ii.222 (id.); SN.iv.347 (˚ṃ bhañjati destroy the good or welfare, always with musāvādena by lying cp. attha\-bhañjanaka); AN.i.61 (˚ṃ anubhoti to fare well to have a (good) result); AN.iii.364 (samparāyika a. profit in the future life); AN.v.223 sq. (anattho ca attho ca detriment & profit); Iti.44 (variant reading attā better); Snp.37, Snp.58 (= Cnd.26, where the six kinds of advantages are enumerated as att˚ par˚ ubhay˚, i.e. advantage, resulting for oneself for others, for both; diṭṭhadhammik˚ samparāyik˚ param gain for this life, for a future life, and highest gain of all, i.e. Arahantship); Snp.331 (ko attho supitena what good is it to sleep = na hi sakkā supantena koci attho papuṇituṃ Snp\-a.338; cp. ko attho supinena te Pv.ii.6#1) Pv\-a.30 (atthaṃ sādheti does good, results in good, Pv\-a.69 (samparāyikena atthena)  
   ■ dat. *[atthāya](atthāya.md)* for the good for the benefit of (gen.); to advantage, often eombd. with hitāya sukhāya, e.g. DN.iii.211 sq.; Iti.79  
   ■ Kp.viii.1 (to my benefit); Pv.i.4#3 (= upakārāya Pv\-a.18), Pv.ii.12#9 (to great advantage). See also below 6.  
   ■ Sometimes in a more concrete meaning = riches, wealth e.g. Ja.i.256 (= vaḍḍhiṃ C.); Ja.iii.394 (id.); Pv.iv.1#4 (dhanaṃ Pv\-a.219)  
   ■ Often as\-˚: *att˚*; one’s own wellfare, usually combd. with *par˚*; and *ubhay˚*; (see above SN.ii.29; SN.v.121; AN.i.158, AN.i.216; AN.iii.63 sq.; AN.iv.134; Snp.75 (att\-aṭṭha, variant reading attha Cnd), Snp.284 (atta\-d\-attha); *uttam˚*; the highest gain, the very best thing Dhp.386 (= arahatta Dhp\-a.iv.142); Snp.324 (= arahatta Snp\-a.332); *param˚* id. Cnd.26; *sad˚*; one’s own weal DN.ii.141; MN.i.4; SN.ii.29; SN.v.145; AN.i.144; *[sāttha](sāttha.md)* (adj.) connected with advantage beneficial, profitable (of the Dhamma; or should we take it as “with the meaning, in spirit”? see *[sāttha](sāttha.md)* DN.i.62; SN.v.352; AN.ii.147; AN.iii.152; Cnd.316.
2. need, want (c. instr.), use (for = instr.) SN.i.37 (˚jāta when need has arisen, in need); Ja.i.254; Ja.iii.126, Ja.iii.281; Ja.iv.1; Dhp\-a.i.398 (n’ atthi eteh’ attho I have no use for them) Vv\-a.250; Pv\-a.24 (yāvadattha, adj. as much as is needed sufficient = anappaka).
3. sense, meaning, import (of a word), denotation, signification. In this application attha is always spelt *[aṭṭha](aṭṭha.md)* in compounds aṭṭh\-uppatti and aṭṭha\-kathā (see below). On term see also *Cpd.* 4  
   ■ SN.iii.93 (atthaṃ vibhajati explain the sense); AN.i.23 (id.), AN.i.60 (nīt˚ primary meaning, literal meaning; neyy˚ secondary or inferred meaning); AN.ii.189 (˚ṃ ācikkhati to interpret); Snp.126 (˚ṃ pucchita asked the (correct) sense, the lit. meaning), Snp.251 (˚ṃ akkhāti); Thag.374; attho paramo the highest sense the ultimate sense or intrinsic meaning Iti.98, cp. *Cpd.* 6, 81, 223; Mil.28 (paramatthato in the absolute sense) Mil.18 (atthato according to its meaning, opp. vyañjanato by letter, orthographically); Dhp\-a.ii.82; Dhp\-a.iii.175 Kp\-a.81 (pad˚ meaning of a word); Snp\-a.91 (id.); Pv\-a.15 (˚ṃ vadati to explain, interpret), Pv\-a.16, Pv\-a.19 (hitatthadhammatā “fitness of the best sense”, i.e. practical application), Pv\-a.71. Very frequent in Commentary style at the conclusion of an explained passage as *ti attho* “this is the meaning”, thus it is meant, this is the sense, e.g. DN\-a.i.65; Dhp\-a.iv.140, Dhp\-a.iv.141; Pv\-a.33, etc
4. Contrasted with *[dhamma](dhamma.md)* in the combn. attho ca dhammo ca it (attha) refers to the (primary, natural) meaning of the word, while dhamma relates to the (interpreted) meaning of the text, to its bearing on the norm and conduct; or one might say they represent the theoretical and practical side of the text (pāḷi) to be discussed, the “letter” and the “spirit”. Thus at AN.i.69; AN.v.222, AN.v.254; Snp.326 (bhāsitatthañ ca pāḷidhammañ ca Snp\-a.333); Iti.84 (duṭṭho atthaṃ na jānāti dhammaṃ na passati: he realises neither the meaning nor the importance); Dhp.363 (= bhāsitatthañ c’ eva desanādhammañ ca); Ja.ii.353; Ja.vi.368; Cnd.386 (meaning & proper nature); Pv.iii.9#6 (but expld. by Pv\-a.211 as hita = benefit, good, thus referring it to above 1) For the same use see compounds ˚dhamma, ˚paṭisambhidā, esp in adv. use (see under 6) Snp.430 (yen’ atthena for which purpose), Snp.508 (kena atthena variant reading BB for T attanā), Ja.i.411 (atthaṃ vā kāraṇaṃ vā reason and cause); Dhp\-a.ii.95 (\+ kāraṇa(Pv\-a.11 (ayaṃ h’ ettha attho this is the reason why).
5. (in very wide application, covering the same ground as Lat. res & Fr. chose):
   1. matter, affair, thing, often untranslatable and simply to be given as “this” or “that” SN.ii.36 (ekena\-padena sabbo attho vutto the whole matter is said with one word); Ja.i.151 (taṃ atthaṃ the matter); Ja.ii.160 (imaṃ a. this); Ja.vi.289 (taṃ atthaṃ pakāsento); Pv\-a.6 (taṃ atthaṃ pucchi asked it), Pv\-a.11 (visajjeti explains it), Pv\-a.29 (vuttaṃ atthaṃ what had been said), Pv\-a.82 (id.)
   2. affair, cause, case (cp. aṭṭa2 and Lat. causa) Dhp.256, Dhp.331; Mil.47 (kassa atthaṃ dhāresi whose cause do you support, with whom do you agree?). See also *alamattha*.

6. Adv. use of oblique cases in the sense of a prep.:
   1. dat. *[atthāya](atthāya.md)* for the sake of, in order to, for Ja.i.254 dhan’ atthāya for wealth kim˚ what for, why?), Ja.i.279; Ja.ii.133; Ja.iii.54; Dhp\-a.ii.82; Pv\-a.55, Pv\-a.75, Pv\-a.78
   2. acc. *atthaṃ* on account of, in order to, often instead of an infinitive or with another inf. substitute Ja.i.279 (kim˚); Ja.iii.53 (id.); Ja.i.253; Ja.ii.128 Dpvs.vi.79; Dhp\-a.i.397; Pv\-a.32 (dassan˚ in order to see), Pv\-a.78, Pv\-a.167, etc
   3. abl. *atthā* Ja.iii.518 (pitu atthā = atthāya C.)
   4. loc. *atthe* instead of, for Vv\-a.10; Pv\-a.33; etc.
