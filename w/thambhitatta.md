= thambha 2, viz. hardness, rigidity, obduracy, obstinacy Vb.350 *Note.* Quite a late development of the term, caused by a misinterpretation of chambhitatta, is “fluctuation unsteadiness, inflation” at Dhs.965 (in def. of vāyodhātu: chambhittattaṃ [?] thambhitattaṃ. See on this Dhs. trsl. p. 242), & at Vb.168 (in def. of vicikicchā variant reading chambhitatta), and at Asl.338 (of vayo). None of these meanings originally belong to the term thambha.

abstr. to thambha
