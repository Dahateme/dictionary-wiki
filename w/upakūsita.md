at Ja.ii.134 is perhaps faulty for ˚kūḷita, which is suggested by C. expln. “kukkule jhāmo” and also by variant reading ˚kuṭhita (for kuṭṭhita boiled, sweltering, hot). The variant (gloss) *\-kūjita* may have the same origin, viz ˚kūḷita, was however interpreted (variant reading BB.) by ˚kupita (meaning “shaken, disturbed by fire”).
