destroyer of beings Snp.664 (voc. bhūnahu, explained by Snp\-a.479 as “bhūti\-hanaka vuddhi\-nāsaka”; vv.ll. bhūnahaṭa bhūnahoṭa, bhūhata, all showing the difficulty of the archaic word); Ja.v.266 (pl. bhūnahuno, explained by C 272 as “isīnaṃ ativattāro attano vaḍḍhiyā hatattā bh.”). Cp. MN.i.502 (“puritanical” suggested by Lord Chalmers).

difficult to expln; is it an old misspelling for bhūta \+ gha? The latter of *[han](han.md)*?
