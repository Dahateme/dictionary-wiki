soft\-heartedness, kindliness sympathy. Often in triad *[mettā](mettā.md)* (“active love” Snp\-a.128), *[karuṇā](karuṇā.md)* (“preventive love,” ibid.), *[muditā](muditā.md)* (“disinterested love”: modanti vata bho sattā modanti sādhu sutthū ti ādinā mayena hita\-sukh’ âvippayogakāmatā muditā Snp\-a.128); e.g. at DN.i.251; SN.v.118; AN.i.196 etc. (see *[karuṇā](karuṇā.md)*)  
■ Cp. also Snp.73; DN.iii.50 DN.iii.224, DN.iii.248; Mil.332 (˚saññā; \+ mettā˚, karuṇā˚); Vism.318 (where defined as “modanti tāya, taṃ\-samangino sayaṃ vā modati etc.”); Dhs\-a.192. See on term *Dhs trsl.* §251 (where equalled to συγξαιροσύνη); *Cpd.* 24 (called sympathetic & appreciative), 97 (called “congratulatory & benevolent attitude”); *Expos.* 200 (interpretation here refers to *[mudutā](mudutā.md)* Dhs\-a.151 “plasticity”).

abstr. fr. mudu, for the usual *[mudutā](mudutā.md)*, which in P. is only used in ord. sense, whilst *[muditā](muditā.md)* is in pregnant sense. Its semantic relation to mudita (pp of *mud*) has led to an etym. relation in the same sense in the opinion of P. Commentators and the feeling of the Buddhist teachers. That is why Childers also derivers it from *mud*, as does Bdhgh  
■ BSk. after the Pali: *[muditā](muditā.md)* Divy.483
