Nibbuta represents Sk. nirvṛta (e.g. Avs.i.48) as well as nivṛta, both pp. of *vṛ*; which in itself combines two meanings, as exhibited in cognate languages and in Sk. itself: (a) Idg. *ṷer* to cover, cover up (Lat. aperio = \*apa\-veri̯o to cover up, Sk. varutram upper garment, “cover”) and (b) *\*ṷel* to resolve, roll move (Lat. volvo = revolve; Gr. ε ̔́λις, ἐλύω; Sk. vāṇa reed = Lat. ulva; Sk. ūrmi wave; P. valli creeper, valita wrinkled). *\*ṷer* is represented in P. by e.g. vivarati to open, nivāreti to cover, obstruct, nīvaraṇa, nivāraṇa obstruction; *\*ṷel* by āvuta, khandh\-āvāra, parivāra vyāvaṭa (busy with = moving about), samparivāreti Thus we gain the two meanings combined and used promiscuously in the one word because of their semantic affinity: (a) *\*nivṛta* covered up, extinguished, quenched and (b) *\*nirvṛta* without movement, with motion finished (cp. niṭṭhita), ceasing, exhaustion, both represented by P. *[nibbuta](nibbuta.md)*  
■ In derivations we have besides the rootform *vṛ*; (= P. bbu˚) that with guṇa *vṝ* (cp. Sk. vārayati vrāyati) or *vrā* = P.\* bbā˚ (with which also cp. paṭivāṇa = \*prativāraṇa). The former is in nibbuti (ceasing, extinction, with meaning partly influenced by nibbuṭṭhi = Sk. nirvṛṣṭi pouring of water), the latter in instr. *[nibbāti](nibbāti.md)* and *[nibbāyati](nibbāyati.md)* (to cease or to go out) and trs. *[nibbāpeti](nibbāpeti.md)* (Caus.: to make cease, to stop or cool and further in *[nibbāna](nibbāna.md)* (nt. instr. abstr.) (the dying out)
