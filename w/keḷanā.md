desire, greed, usually shown in fondness for articles of personal adornment: thus “selfishness” Vb.351 = DN\-a.i.286 (\+ *[paṭikeḷanā](paṭikeḷanā.md)*). In this passage it is given as a rather doubtful expln of *[cāpalla](cāpalla.md)*, which would connect it with *kṣvel* to jump, or *khel* to swing, oscillate, waver cp. expln Dhtp.278 kela khela = calane. Another passage is Cnd.585, where it is combined with *[parikeḷanā](parikeḷanā.md)* and acts as syn. of vibhūsanā.

fr. kilissati? or is it kheḷana?
