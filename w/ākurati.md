to be hoarse Mil.152 (kaṇṭho ākurati).

onomat. to sound\-root *\*kur = \*kor* as in Lat. cornix, corvus etc. See gala note 2 B and cp. kukkuṭa kokila, khaṭa etc., all words expressing a rasping noise in the throat. The attempts at etym. by Trenckner (Mil p.425 as Denom. of ākula) & Morris (J.P.T.S. 1886 154 as contr. Denom. of ankura “intumescence”, thus meaning “to swell”) are hardly correct
