adjective having life or consciousness or sense, endowed with vitality. Found in the four Nikāyas only in *one* standard passage in the same connection, viz. *sa\-viññāṇaka kāya* “the body with its viññāṇa” (i.e. life\-force or mind): SN.ii.253; SN.iii.80, SN.iii.169 SN.v.311; AN.i.132; AN.iv.53. Thus (sa˚) should be read at all passages  
■ Later in contrast pair *sa˚*; and *a˚*; i.e. with life & without, alive & lifeless, animate & inanimate, e.g. Ja.i.466, Ja.i.468; Dhp\-a.i.6; Pv\-a.130.
