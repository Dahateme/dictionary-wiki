Peyya1

to be drunk, drinkable, only in compound or neg. *[apeyya](apeyya.md)* undrinkable AN.iii.188; Ja.iv.205 Ja.iv.213 (apo apeyyo). *maṇḍa˚*; to be drunk like cream, i.e. of the best quality SN.ii.29. *manāpika˚*; sweet to drink Mil.313. *duppeyya* difficult to drink Sdhp.158. See also *[kākapeyya](kākapeyya.md)*.

grd. of pibati

Peyya2

= piya, only in compounds *vajja˚*; kindness of language, kind speech, one of the 4 sangaha\-vatthus (grounds of popularity) AN.ii.32, AN.ii.248; AN.iv.219, AN.iv.364; DN.iii.190, DN.iii.192, DN.iii.232; Ja.v.330. Cp. BSk. priya\-vādya Mvu.i.3; and *\-vācā* kind language DN.iii.152; Vv.84#36 (= piyavacana Vv\-a.345)  
■ It is doubtful whether *vāca\-peyya* at Snp.303 (Ep. of sacrifice) is the same as ˚vācā (as adj.), or whether it represents vāja\-peyya [Vedic vāja sacrificial food] as Bdhgh explains it at Snp\-a.322 (= vājam ettha pivanti; variant reading vāja˚), thus peyya peyya1.
