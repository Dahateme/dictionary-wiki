pea\-hen a peacock Ja.ii.275 (˚upasevin, see C. on this passage), Ja.vi.218, Ja.vi.497; Pv\-a.142; Dhp\-a.i.394. A peacock’s tail (sometimes used as a fan) is denoted in var. terms in compounds, as *mora\-kalāpa* Dhp\-a.i.387; *\-[piccha](piccha.md)* Vin.i.186 *\-[piñcha](piñcha.md)* Vin.ii.130; *\-pīñja* Pv\-a.142, Pv\-a.176; Vv\-a.147 *\-sikali* (?) Kp\-a.49; *\-[hattha](hattha.md)* Vv.33#44 (= mayūra\-piñjehi kataṃ makasa\-vījaniṃ); Pv.iii.1#17. Perhaps also as *morakkha* “a peacock’s eye” at Vb\-a.63 (morakkhaka loha, a kind of copper, grouped with pisācaloha). It is more likely however that *morakkha* is distorted fr. *\*mauryaka*, patronymic of *mura*, a local (tribal) designation (cp. murala), then by pop. etym connected with mora peacock. With this cp. Sk *moraka* “a kind of steel” BR.

the contracted, regular P. form of \*Sk. mayūra, viâ \*ma\-ūra → mora. See also Geiger, *P.Gr.* § 27 Pischel, *Prk. Gr.* § 166. Vedic only mayūrī
