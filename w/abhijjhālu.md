Abhijjhālū & ˚u

(adj.) covetous DN.i.139; DN.iii.82; SN.ii.168; SN.iii.93; AN.i.298; AN.ii.30, AN.ii.59, AN.ii.220 (an˚ \+ avyapannacitto sammādiṭṭhiko at conclusion of sīla); AN.v.92 sq., AN.v.163, AN.v.286 sq. Iti.90, Iti.91; Pp.39, Pp.40.

cp. jhāyin from jhāyati1; abhijjhālu with ˚ālu for ˚āgu which in its turn is for āyin. The B.Sk. form is abhidyālu, e.g. Divy.301, a curious reconstruction
