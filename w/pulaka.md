shrivelled grain Mil.232 (sukka\-yava˚ of dried barley); Dhp\-a.ii.154 (SS; T. reads *mūlakaṃ* which is explained by Bdhgh as “nitthusaṃ katvā ussedetvā gahita\-yava\-taṇḍula vuccanti” ibid). Here belongs *pulasa\-patta* of Ja.iii.478. (vv.ll. pulā˚, mūlā˚ mulā˚; explained by C. as “saṇhāṇi pulasa\-gaccha\-paṇṇāni, thus taking pulasa as a kind of shrub, prob. because the word was not properly understood).

cp. Sk. pulāka, Halāyudha 5, 43; not Sk. pulaka, as Kern,
