to move, to stir; a misunderstood term. Found in aor. *samacopi* (so read for T. samadhosi & variant reading samañcopi) mañcake “he stirred fr. his bed” SN.iii.120, SN.iii.125; and *sañcopa* (pret.) Ja.v.340 (variant reading for T. sañcesuṃ āsanā; C. explains as “caliṃsu”).

cp. Sk. copati, as α ̔́πας in Mhbh. We should expect *copeti* in Pāli, fr. *cup* to stir
