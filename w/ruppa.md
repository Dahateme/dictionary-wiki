in *ruppa\-rūpakaṃ* (nt.) Thig.394 is not clear. It refers to something which is not rūpa, yet pretends to be rūpa, i.e. a sham performance or show. Thus ruppa may correspond to \*rūpya & with rūpaka mean “having the form (i.e. the appearance) of form, i.e. substantiality” The Cy. (Thag\-a.259) interprets as “rūpiya\-rūpasadisaṃ sāraṃ sāraṃ upaṭṭhahantaṃ asāran ti attho” and Mrs. Rh. D. (*Sisters*, p. 154) trsls: “deluded by puppet shows (seen in the midst of the crowd).”
