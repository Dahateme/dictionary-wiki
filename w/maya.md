adjective (\-˚ only) made of, consisting of  
■ An interesting analysis (interesting for judging the views and sense of etymology of an ancient commentator) of *[maya](maya.md)* is given by Dhammapāla at Vv\-a.10 where he distinguishes 6 meanings of the word, viz 1 *asma* \-d\-atthe, i.e. “myself” (as representing mayaṃ!). 2 *[paññatti](paññatti.md)* “regulation” (same as (1) according to example given, but constructed syntectically quite diff. by Dhp.). 3 *[nibbatti](nibbatti.md)* “origin” (arising from, with example mano\-maya “produced by mind”). 4 *[manomaya](manomaya.md)* “spiritually” (same as 3) 5 *vikār’ atthe* “alteration” (? more like product consistency, substance), with example “sabbe\-maṭṭikāmaya\-kuṭikā.” 6 *pada\-pūraṇa matte* to make up a foot of the verse (or add a syllable for the sake of completeness with example “dānamaya, sīlamaya” (= dana, sīla).
