to fail, miss; only at MN.i.327 (puriso narakapapāte papatanto hatthehi ca pādehi ca paṭhaviṃ virāgeyya “would miss the earth”; differently Neumann “Boden zu fassen suchte,” i.e. tried to touch ground)\-Perhaps also in *virāgāya* (either as ger. to virāgeti or as instr. to virāga in sense of *virādha(na)*) Pv.i.11#7 (sukhaṃ virāgāya, with gloss virāgena, i.e. spurning one’s good fortune; explained as *virajjhitvā virādhetvā* at Pv\-a.59). Cp. virāye (= virāge?) at Thag.1113 (see *[virādheti](virādheti.md)*).

for virādheti, as in BSk. virāgayati (e.g. Divy.131, Divy.133) to displease, estrange, the fig. meaning of virāgeti like BSk. ārāgeti for Pāli ārādheti in lit & fig meanings
