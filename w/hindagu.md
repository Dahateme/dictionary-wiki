# hindagu

```

man, only found in the Niddesa in stock defn of *[jantu](jantu.md)* or *[nara](nara.md)*; both spellings (with & without h) occur; see Mnd.3 = Cnd.249.

probably for *indagu*, inda \+ gu (= ˚ga), i.e. sprung from Indra. The *h* perhaps fr. *hindu*. The spelling *h˚*; is a corrupt one
