at DN.i.6 (in the lists of forbidden crafts) refers to some magic art. The proper meaning of the word was already unknown when Bdhgh at DN\-a.i.84 explained it as “ghana\-tāḷaṃ” (cymbal beating) with remark “mantena mata\-sarīr’ uṭṭhāpanan ti eke” (some take it to be raising the dead by magic charms). Rh. D. at *Dial.* i.8 translates “chanting of bards” (cp. vetālika). It is of dialectical origin.
