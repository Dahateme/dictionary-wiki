Vaya1 & vayo

neuter age, especially young age, prime, youth; meaning “old age” when characterized as such or contrasted to youth (the ord. term for *old* age being *[jarā](jarā.md)*). Three “ages” or “periods of life” are usually distinguished, viz. *paṭhama˚*; youth, *majjhima˚*; middle age, *pacchima˚*; old age, e.g. at Ja.i.79; Vism.619; Dhp\-a.iii.133  
■ *vayo anuppatta* one who has attained old age, old DN.i.48 (= pacchima\-vayaṃ anuppatta DN\-a.i.143) Snp.p.50, 92  
■ Cp. Dhp.260; Ja.i.138 (vayo\-harā kesā) Vism.619 (the 3 vayas with subdivisions into dasakas or decades of life); Mhvs.2, Mhvs.26 (ekūnatiṃso vayasā 29 years of age); Pv\-a.5 (paṭhama\-vaye when quite young), Pv\-a.36 (id.; just grown up). In compounds vaya˚.

* *\-[kalyāṇa](kalyāṇa.md)* charm of youth Dhp\-a.i.387.
* *\-ppatta* come of age, fit to marry (at 16) Vv\-a.120; Pv\-a.3, Pv\-a.112; Thag\-a.266.

Vedic vayas vitality, age; to be distinguished from another vayas meaning “fowl.” The latter is probably meant at Dhtp.232 (& Dhtm.332) with defn “gamane.” The etym. of vayo (age) is connected with Sk. vīra = Lat. vir. man, hero, vīs strength; Gr. ι ̓́ς sinew, ι ̓́φιος strong; Sk. vīḍayati to make fast, also veśati; whereas *vayas* (fowl) corresponds with Sk. vayasa (bird) & viḥ to Gr. αἰετός eagle, οἰωνός bird of prey, Lat. avis bird
