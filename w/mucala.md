occurs as simplex only in Np. Mahā\- *[mucala](mucala.md)* \-mālaka Mhvs.15, Mhvs.36. It refers to the tree *[mucalinda](mucalinda.md)*, of which it may be a short form. On the other hand *mucal\-inda* appears to the speaker of Pāli a cp. noun, viz. king of the mucala(s) (trees). Its (late?) Sk. correspondent is *mucilinda*, of which the P. form may be the regular representative (cp. Geiger *P.Gr.* § 34).
