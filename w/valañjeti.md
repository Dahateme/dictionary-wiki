» Pali Grammar

 § 66#1), the root *lañj* being given as a Sk. root in meaning “to fry,” “to be strong,” and a variety of others (see Mon. Williams s. v. *lañj*). But the root & its derivations are only found in lexicographical and grammatical works, therefore it is doubtful whether it is genuine. *lañja* is given as “pada,” i.e. track, place foot, and also “tail.” We are inclined to see in *lañj* a by\-form of *lañch*, which is a variant of *lakṣ* “to mark” etc. (cp. lañcha, lañchaka, ˚ana, ˚ita). Thus the meaning would range from originally “trace,” mark off, enclose, to: “being enclosed,” assigned or belonging to; i.e. moving (in), frequenting etc., as given in Commentarial explanations. There seems to be a Singhalese word at the root of it as it is certainly dialectical.  
■ The Dhtm (522) laconically defines *valañj* as “valañjane”.
