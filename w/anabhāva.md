the utter cessation of becoming. In the oldest Pali only in adj. form anabhāvaṃ kata or gata. This again found only in a string of four adjectives together expressing the most utter destruction. They are used at Vin.iii.3 of bad qualities, at SN.ii.63 of certain wrong opinions, at MN.i.487; SN.iv.62 = SN.v.527 of the khandas, at MN.i.331 of the Mental Intoxications (Āsavas) at AN.iv.73 of certain tastes, of a bad kamma AN.i.135, of evil passions AN.i.137, AN.i.184, AN.i.218; AN.ii.214 of pride AN.ii.41 of craving AN.ii.249, of the bonds AN.iv.8. In the supplement to the Dīgha (DN.iii.326) and in the Itivuttaka (p. 115) a later idiom, anabhāvaṃ gameti, cause to perish is used of evil thoughts. Bdhgh (quoted Vin.iii.267) reports as variant reading anubhāva. Cp. Mnd.90; and Nd ii.under pahīna.
