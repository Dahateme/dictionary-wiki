doubtful in its meaning; occurs at Vin.i.48 = Vin.ii.209 as ullokā paṭhamaṃ ohāreti, trsl. *Vin Texts* by “a cloth to remove cobwebs”, but better by Andersen *Pāli Reader* as “as soon as it is seen”; at Vin.ii.151 the translators give “a cloth placed under the bedstead to keep the stuffing from coming out”. See on term Morris J.P.T.S. 1885, 31  
■ In cpd ulloka\-paduma at Ja.vi.432 it may mean “bright lotus” (lit. to be looked at) See ulloketi.
