```

accessory wood, wood surrounding the pith of a tree, always with ref. to trees (freq. in similes), in sequence; *mūla sāra, pheggu, taca, papaṭikā* etc. It is represented as next to the pith, but inferior and worthless. At all passages contrasted with *[sāra](sāra.md)* (pith, substance). Thus at MN.i.192 sq., MN.i.488; DN.iii.51; SN.iv.168; AN.i.152 (pheggu sāra, variant reading phaggu); AN.ii.110 = Pp.52; AN.iii.20; Ja.iii.431 (opp. sāra); Mil.267, Mil.413 (tacchako phegguṃ apaharitvā sāraṃ ādiyati).
