* *\-bhataṃ* is an unexplained α ̔́πας λεγομένον, difficult of analysis because occurring in only one ster. phrase, viz. *yathā bhataṃ nikkhitto evaṃ niraye* (& sagge) at MN.i.71; SN.iv.325 (where T. has yathāhataṃ, variant reading bhataṃ); AN.i.8, AN.i.105, AN.i.292, AN.i.297; AN.ii.71 AN.ii.83; Iti.12, Iti.14, Iti.26. We have analyzed it as y. bhataṃ in Corr. to pt. 3; vol. ii.100 (“according to his upbringing”), but we should rather deviate from this expln because the P. usage in this case would prefer the nom instead of the (adv.) acc. nt. It remains doubtful whether we should separate yathā or yath’ *ābhataṃ* Suggestions of a translation are the foll. 1 “as soon as brought or taken” (see Dict. *s*. v. ābhata); 2 “as one has brought” (merit or demerit); thus taking ābhataṃ as irregular ger. of ā \+ *bhar*, translation suggested by the reading *[āharitvā](āharitvā.md)* (yathâharitvā) in the complementary stanzas at Iti.12 & Iti.14; 3 “according to merit or reward,” after Kern’s suggestion,

   s.v. to read yathā bhaṭaṃ, the difficulty being that bhaṭa is nowhere found as variant reading of bhata in this phrase; nor that bhaṭa occurs in the meaning of “reward.”  
  ■ There is a strong likelihood of *(ā)bhata* resembling *[āhata](āhata.md)* (āhaṭa?) in meaning “as brought,” on account of, cp. Iti context and reading at SN.iv.325; still the phrase remains not sufficiently cleared up.  
  ■ Seidenstūcker’s translation has been referred to above (under haritvā) as unbefitting.  
  ■ The suspicion of *[yathābhataṃ](yathābhataṃ.md)* being a veiled (corrupted) *[yathābhūtaṃ](yathābhūtaṃ.md)* has presented itself to us before (see vol. I. under ābhata). The meaning may suggest something like the latter, in as far as “in truth, “surely” is not far off the point. Anyhow we shall have to settle on a meaning like “according to merit”, without being able to elucidate the phrase in all its details.  
  ■ There is another *[yathābhataṃ](yathābhataṃ.md)* in passage… ussavo hoti, yathābhataṃ lasuṇaṃ parikkhayaṃ agamāsi “the garlic diminished as soon as it was brought” Vin.iv.258. Here *[ābhata](ābhata.md)* stands in rel. to *[harāpeti](harāpeti.md)* (to have it fetched & brought) and is clearly pp. of *ābharati*.
* *\-bhucca* as is the case, i.e. as one might expect, evident, real, in conformity with the truth DN.i.12; DN.ii.222; Mil.183, Mil.351; Thig.159 (= yathābhūtaṃ Thag\-a.142); Pv\-a.30, Pv\-a.31 (˚guṇā).
* *\-[bhutta](bhutta.md)* see *[bhutta](bhutta.md)*.
* *\-bhūta(ṃ)* in reality, in truth, really, definitely absolutely; as ought to be, truthfully, in its real essence. Very freq. in var. combinations which see collected & classified as regards Saṃyutta & Anguttara\-Nikāyas in Index vols to these texts. E.g. SN.iv.195 (vacanaṃ, epithet of nibbāna); SN.v.440 (abhisamaya); Snp.194, Snp.202, Snp.653; Dhp.203; Pv\-a.215 (guṇa). *yathābhūtaṃ pajānāti* he knows as an absolute truth or in reality DN.i.83, DN.i.162; SN.iv.188 SN.v.304 & passim; ditto *yathābhūtaṃ jānāti passati* Pts.ii.62. Similarly with noun: *yathābhūta\-ñāṇa* absolute knowledge SN.v.144; Pts.ii.63 = Vism.605 (\+ sammādassana); Vism.438, Vism.629, Vism.695; Vb\-a.459 (= maggañāṇa); also as *˚ñāṇa\-dassana* in same meaning: AN.iii.19, AN.iii.200; AN.iv.99, AN.iv.336; AN.v.2 sq., AN.v.311 sq.; Pts.i.33, Pts.i.43 sq. Pts.ii.11 sq.; Ne.29.
* *\-[mano](mano.md)* according to (his) mind Snp.829; Mnd.170 (explained as nom. = yathācitto, yathāsankappo yathāviññāṇo).
* *\-ruciṃ* according to pleasure or liking Mhvs.4, Mhvs.43 (ruci T.; ruciṃ variant reading; thus generally in Mvu.); Mhvs.5, Mhvs.230 (˚ruci); Mhvs.22, Mhvs.58 (˚ruci).
* *\-[vādin](vādin.md)* as speaking, as he speaks (followed by *tathā\-kārin* so doing) DN.ii.224, DN.ii.229; Snp.357; Iti.122.
* *\-vidhi(ṃ)* duly fitly Mhvs.10, Mhvs.79.
* *\-[vihita](vihita.md)* as appointed or arranged Mhvs.10, Mhvs.93.
* *\-vuḍḍhaṃ* according to seniority Vin.ii.221; Mhbv.90 (T. reads ˚buḍḍhaṃ).
* *\-vutta(ṃ)* as is said, i.e. as mentioned, aforesaid, of this kind Mhvs.34, Mhvs.57; Pv\-a.45, Pv\-a.116 (˚o puggalo).
* *\-saka(ṃ)* each his own, according to his (or her) own, respective(ly) Vism.525; Snp\-a.8, Snp\-a.9; Vv\-a.7; Mhvs.5, Mhvs.230 (here simply “their own”).
* *\-[sata](sata.md)* saintly (?), mindful Thag.981 (cp. yathā cārin & *Brethren* p. 342).
* *\-satti(ṃ)* according to one’s power SN.iv.348 (\+ yathābalaṃ); Dhp\-a.i.107 (variant reading for ˚balaṃ); Sdhp.97.
* *\-satthaṃ* according to the precepts as law ordains MN.iii.10 (perhaps an error for yathāsaddha).
* *\-saddhaṃ* acc. to faith, as is one’s faith Dhp.249.
* *\-[santhatika](santhatika.md)* accepting whatever seat is offered DN.i.167; AN.iii.220; Pp.69; Thag.855 *\-˚anga* one of the 13 dhutangas Mil.342, Mil.359; Vism.61, Vism.78.
