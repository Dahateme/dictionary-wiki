in ˚gataṃ sallaṃ at Ja.vi.78 to be explained not with C. as from paṭi \+ camati (*cam* to wash, cp. ācamati) which does not agree with the actual meaning, but according to Kern, Toev. ii.29, s. v. as elliptical for paṭibhinna\-camma, i.e. piercing the skin so as to go right through (to the opp. side) which falls in with the C. expln “vāmapassena pavisitvā dakkhiṇapassena viniggatan ti.”
