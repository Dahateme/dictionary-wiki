the Vedic differentiations *vetti* “to know” and *[vindati](vindati.md)* “to find” are both in Pāli, but only in sporadic forms, some of which are archaic and therefore only found in poetry. Of *vid* are more frequent the Pass. *[vijjati](vijjati.md)* and derivations fr the Caus. *ved˚*. The root *vind* occurs only in the present tense and its derivations

1. *vid* to know, to ascertain: The old Vedic pres. *vetti* only at Thag.497 (spelt veti). Another old aor. is *[vedi](vedi.md)* [Sk. ayedīt] Dhp.419, Dhp.423; Ja.iii.420 (= aññāsi); Ja.iv.35 (here perhaps as aor. to Caus. *[vedeti](vedeti.md)*: to cause to know or feel). Remnants of the old *perfect* tense 3rd pl. [Sk. viduḥ] are *vidū & viduṃ* (appears as *vidu* in verse), e.g. at Thag.497; Snp.758; Pv.ii.7#4 (= jānanti Pv\-a.102); Ja.v.62 (= vijānanti C.); Mhvs.23, Mhvs.78. The old participle of the same tense is *[vidvā](vidvā.md)* [= Sk. vidvān; cp. Geiger
