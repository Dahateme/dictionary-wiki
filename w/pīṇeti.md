to gladden please, satisfy, cheer; to invigorate, make strong, often in phrase (attānaṃ) *sukheti pīṇeti* “makes happy and pleases” DN.i.51; DN.iii.130 sq.; SN.i.90; SN.iv.331; Pv\-a.283 cp. Dhs\-a.403 (sarīraṃ p.). It also occurs in def. of pīti (pīṇayatī ti pīti) at Vism.143 = Dhs\-a.115  
pp *[pīṇita](pīṇita.md)*.

cp. Vedic prīṇāti, *prī*, see *[piya](piya.md)*. The meaning in Pāli however has been partly confused with *pī*, pinvati (see *[pīna](pīna.md)*), as suggested by Bdhgh in DN\-a.i.157: “pīṇentī ti pīṇitaṃ *thāma\-* bal’ ûpetaṃ karonti”
