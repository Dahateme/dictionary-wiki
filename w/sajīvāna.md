```

at SN.i.44 is *metric* spelling for *sa\-jīvana* “same livelihood,” in phrase *kiṃsu kamme s*. “what is (of) the same livelihood in work, i.e. occupation?” The form is the same as *jīvāna* at Ja.iii.353. Taken wrongly as *gen. pl.* by Mrs. Rh. D. in translation (*K.S.* i.63): “who in their work is *mate to sons of men?*” following Bdhgh’s wrong interpretation (see *K.S.* i.321) as “kammena saha *jīvantānan;* kammadutiyakā nāma honti.”

sa2 = saṃ, \+ jīvana
