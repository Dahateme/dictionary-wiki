Dubbha & Dūbha

adjective deceiving, hurting, trying to injure Vin.ii.203 (= Iti.86 where dubbhe); Pv.ii.9#3 (mitta˚). *adubbha* one who does not do harm, harmless Pv.ii.9#8 (˚pāṇin = ahiṃsakahattha). As nt. harmlessness, frankness, friendliness, good\-will Vin.i.347 (adrūbhāya, but cp. vv.ll. p. Vin.i.395 adubbhaya & adrabbhāvāya); SN.i.225 (adubbhāya trustily); Ja.i.180 (id. as adūbhāya); spelt wrongly *[adrūbhaka](adrūbhaka.md)* (for adubbhaka, with variant reading adrabhaka in expl. of adubbha\-pāṇin) at Ja.vi.311. *Note:* dabhāya (dat.) is also used in Sk. in sense of an adv. or infinitive which confirms the etymology of the word. Cp. dobha.

Sk. dambha, see *[dubbhati](dubbhati.md)*
