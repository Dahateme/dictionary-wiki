indeclinable allowable, possible (with inf.); usually neg (thus = Prohibitive!) Snp.393 (na l. phassetuṃ; Snp\-a p.376 explains by “sakkā”), Snp.590; Pv.ii.6#10; Ja.i.64 (na l. tayā pabbajituṃ), Ja.i.145 (id.), Pv\-a.96 (= laddhuṃ sakkā).

best to be taken, with Pischel, *Prk. Gr.* § 465, as an old Opt. 3rd sg., like *[sakkā](sakkā.md)* which corresponds to Vedic śakyāt. Thus labbhā = \*labhyāt, as in Māgadhī
