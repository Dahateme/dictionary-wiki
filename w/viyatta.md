1. (adj.) determined, of settled opinion, learned, accomplished; only in stock phrase *sāvakā viyattā vinītā visāradā* (which Rh. D trsls “true hearers, *wise* and well\-trained, ready etc. *Dial.* ii. 114) at DN.ii.104 = AN.iv.310 = SN.v.260 = Ud.63. The BSk. (at Divy.202) has śrāvakāh (for bhikkhū!) paṇḍitā bhaviṣyanti *vyaktā* vinītā viśāradāh.
2. separated, split, dissenting, heretic Snp.800 (= *vavatthita* bhinna dvejjhāpanna etc. Cnd.108; = bhinna Snp\-a.530). Cp. the *two* meanings of *vavatthita* (= \*vyakta), which quasi\-correspond to viyatta 1 & 2 At this passage the variant reading (all SS of the Commentary); *viyutta* is perhaps to be perferred to *[viyatta](viyatta.md)*.

*Note.* It is to be noted that *[viyatta](viyatta.md)* in § 1 does not occur in poetry, but seems to have spelling viy˚ because of the foll. vinīta and visārada. Cp. *vyatta & veyyatta*.

cp. Sk. vyakta, vi \+ pp. of *añj*
