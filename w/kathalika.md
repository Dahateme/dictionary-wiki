, always in combination pād’odaka pāda\-pīṭha pāda\-k˚: either a *cloth* to wipe the feet with after washing them, or a *footstool* Vin.i.9, Vin.i.47 Vin.ii.22 sq., Vin.ii.210, Vin.ii.216. At Vv\-a.8 however with pāda\-pīṭha explained as a footstool (pāda\-ṭhāpana\-yoggaṃ dārukhaṇḍaṃ āsanaṃ). Bdhgh (on CV ii.1.1) explained pādapīṭha as a stool to put the washed foot on, pāda\- *[kathalika](kathalika.md)* as a stool to put the unwashed foot on, or a cloth to rub the feet with (ghaṃsana).

the meaning “bowl” seems to be preferable to Bdhgh’s forced interpretation as “towel.”
