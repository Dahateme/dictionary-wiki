wheel for raising water from a well Bdgh. on cakkavaṭṭaka at cv v.16, 2 (Vin.ii.318). So read for T. arahatta\-ghaṭi\-yanta acc to Morris, J.P.T.S. 1885, 30; cp. also *Vin. Texts* iii.112  
■ The 2rd part of the cpd. is doubtful; Morris & Aufrecht compare the modern Hindī form arhaṭ or rahaṭ “a well\-wheel”.

Sk. araghaṭṭaka (so Halāyudha, see Aufrecht p. 138), dialect.
