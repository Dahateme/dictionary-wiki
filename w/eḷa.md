in *[eḷamūga](eḷamūga.md)* deaf & dumb AN.ii.252; AN.iii.436; AN.iv.226; Mil.20, Mil.251 (cp. *Mil trsl.* ii.71). A rather strange use and expln. of eḷamūga (with ref. to a snake “spitting”) we find at Ja.iii.347, where it is expld. as “eḷa\-paggharantena mukhena eḷamūgaṃ” i.e. called eḷamūga because of the saliva (foam?) dripping from its mouth, variant reading elamukha  
■ Cp. *neḷa & aneḷa*.
