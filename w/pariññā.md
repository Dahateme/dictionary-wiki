Pariññā1

feminine accurate or exact knowledge, comprehension full understanding MN.i.66, MN.i.84; SN.iii.26 (yo rāgakkhayo dosā˚ moha˚ ayaṃ vuccati p.), SN.iii.159 sq., SN.iii.191; SN.iv.16, SN.iv.51, SN.iv.138, SN.iv.206, SN.iv.253 sq.; SN.v.21, SN.v.55 sq., SN.v.145, SN.v.236, SN.v.251, SN.v.292; AN.i.277 (kāmānaṃ rūpānaṃ vedanānaṃ), AN.i.299; AN.v.64 Pp.37; Ne.19, Ne.20, Ne.31; Kp\-a.87; Snp\-a.251  
■ In exegetical literature *three* pariññās are distinguished viz. ñāta˚, tīraṇa˚ pahāna˚, which are differently interpreted & applied according to the various contexts See e.g. the detailed interpretation at Mnd.52 sq. Cnd.413; Ja.vi.259 (where ñāṇa˚ for ñāta˚); Dhp\-a.ii.172 (in ref. to food); mentioned at Snp\-a.517  
■ adj. *[pariñña](pariñña.md)* \-The form *[pariññāya](pariññāya.md)* is an apparent instr., but in reality (in form & meaning) the ger. of parijānāti (like abhiññāya → abhijānitvā) for the usual parijānitvā It is freq. found in poetry & in formulas (like yathābhūtaṃ p.); its meaning is “knowing well in right knowledge”: SN.v.182; Snp.455, Snp.737, Snp.778 (= parijānitvā Mnd.51 sq.), Snp.1082 (corresp. with pahāya, cp. similar phrase pahāya parijānitvā Dhp\-a.iv.232); Iti.62; Ja.vi.259.

cp. Epic Sk. parijñāna; the form parijñā given by BR only with the one ref. Vyutp. 160; fr pari \+ *jñā*

Pariññā2

indeclinable having full knowledge or understanding of Snp.779 (= parijānitvā Mnd.56 & Snp\-a.518); Iti.4 (perhaps to be read pariññāya for pariññā so).
