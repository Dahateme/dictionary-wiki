Māla (māḷa)
1. mud [is it mis\-spelling of mala?], in *pakka\-m˚\-kalala* (boiling mud) Ja.vi.400. Kern,
   » Toevoegselen

    s. v. believes to see the same word in phrase *mālā\-kacavara* at Ja.ii.416 (but very doubtful).
2. perhaps froth, dirty surface, in *pheṇa˚*; Mil.117 (cp. mālin 2) where it may however be *[māla](māla.md)* (“wreaths of foam”).
3. in *asi˚*; the interpretation given under *[asi](asi.md)* (as “dirt see above p. 88) has been changed into “sword\-garland, thus taking it as *[mālā](mālā.md)*. Malaka (Malaka)
