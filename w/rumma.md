adjective miserable, dirty, poorly, in compounds *\-rūpin* Ja.iv.387 (= lūkhavesa C.), with variant reading duma˚; and *\-vāsin* poorly dressed Ja.iv.380.

put down (rightly) by Geiger, *P.Gr.* § 53 as *different* fr. Sk. rukma (shining); Morris, *J.P.T.S.* 1893 12 tried the etym. rumma = Sk. *rumra* “tawny,” oṛ rukma (rukmin) shiny. It is still an unsolved problem It may not be far off to trace a relation (by miswriting dissimilation or false analogy) to *[ruppa](ruppa.md)* in sense of ruppati, or to *ruj*, or even *[rudda](rudda.md)*. The C. expln of *all* the rumma\- & rummin passages is; *anañjita*, i.e. unkempt
