abundant, numerous, most. Not found as adj. by itself, except in phrase *yebhuyya\-vasena* mostly, as a rule Thag\-a.51 and Pv\-a.136, which is identical with the usual instr. *[yebhuyyena](yebhuyyena.md)* occurring as adv. “as according to most,” i.e.

1. almost all, altogether, practically (as in our phrase “practically dead”), mostly DN.i.105 (addasā dvattiṃsa lakkhanāṇi y. ṭhapetvā dve: all except two) = DN.i.109; Vin.iii.29 sq.; Ja.i.246 (gāmako y andha\-bāla\-manussehi yeva ussanno the village was peopled by mostly foolish folk); Ja.v.335 (y. asīti\-mahātherā, altogether)
2. as it happens (or happened) usually, occasionally, as a rule, ordinarily DN.i.17 (saṃvaṭṭamāne loke y. [as a rule (adj.)] sattā Ābhassarasaṃvaṭṭanikā honti; explained by half allegorical, half popular etym. at DN\-a.i.110 as follows: “ye upari Brahma\-lokesu vā Āruppesu vā nibbattanti, tadavasese sandhāya vuttaṃ”); DN.ii.139: yebhuyyena dasasu loka\-dhātusu devatā sannipatitā (as a rule) Snp.p.107 (= bahukāni Snp\-a.451); Mil.6 (y. Himavantam eva gacchanti: usually); DN\-a.i.280 (ordinarily) Vv\-a.234 (occasionally), Vv\-a.246 (pihita\-dvāram eva hoti usually); Pv\-a.2 (Sattari tattha tattha viharante y tāya tāya atth’ uppattiyā), Pv\-a.46 (tassā kesa\-sobhaṃ disvā taruṇa\-janā y. tattha paṭibaddha\-cittā adesuṃ invariably)  
   ■ *na yebhuyyena* not as a rule, usually not (at all): nâpi y. ruditena kāci attha\-siddhi Pv\-a.63.

ye = yad in Māgadhī form; thus yad bhūya = yad bhiyya “what is more or most(ly)”
