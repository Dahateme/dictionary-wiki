Samma1

a term of familiar address DN.i.49, DN.i.225; DN\-a.i.151; Vin.ii.161; Ja.i.59; Pv\-a.204; plur. sammā Vin.ii.161.

as to etym. Andersen, *P. Reader* ii.263 quite plausibly connects it with Vedic śam (indecl.) “hail”, which is often used in a vocative sense, esp. in combination śam ca yos ca “hail & blessing!”, but also suggests relation to *[sammā](sammā.md)*. Other suggestions see Andersen s.v.
