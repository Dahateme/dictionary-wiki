indeclinable emphatic particle

1. in *affirmative* sentences: part. of assurance emphasis = for sure, very much (so), indeed, truly. *Note.* In connection with a dat. or an infin. the latter only apparently depend upon alaṃ, in reality they belong to the syntax of the whole sentence (as dat. or inf. absolute). It is customary however (since the practice of the Pāli grammarians) to regard them as interdependent and interpret the construction as “fit for, proper” (= yuttaṃ Pāli Com.), which meaning easily arises out of the connotation of alaṃ, e.g. alam eva kātuṃ to be sure, this is to be done = this is proper to be done. In this sense (c. dat.) it may also be compd. with Vedic araṃ c. dat
