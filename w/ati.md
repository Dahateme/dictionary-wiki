### III. ###

A peculiar use of ati is its function in *reduplication\-compounds*, expressing “and, adding further, and so on, even more, etc.” like that of the other comparing or contrasting prefixes a (ā), anu, ava, paṭi, vi (e.g. khaṇḍâkhaṇḍa seṭṭhânuseṭṭhi, chiddâvacchidda, angapaccanga cuṇṇavicuṇṇa). In this function it is however restricted to comparatively few expressions and has not by far the wide range of ā (q.v.), the only phrases being the foll. viz *cakkāticakkaṃ mañcātimañcaṃ bandhati* to heap carts upon carts, couches upon couches (in order to see *[a](a.md)* procession) Vin.iv.360 (Bdhgh); Ja.ii.331; Ja.iv.81; Dhp\-a.iv.61 *\-[devātideva](devātideva.md)* god upon god, god and more than a god (see *[atideva](atideva.md)*); *mānātimāna* all kinds of conceit; *vaṅkātivaṅka* crooked all over Ja.i.160

### IV. ###

Semantically ati is closely related to *abhi*, so that in consequence of dialectical variation we frequently find ati in Pāli, where the corresp. expression in later Sk. shows abhi. See e.g. the foll. cases for comparison: accuṇha ati\-jāta, ˚pīḷita ˚brūheti, ˚vassati, ˚vāyati, ˚veṭheti.

*Note* The contracted (assimilation\-) form of ati before vowels is *acc\-* (q.v.). See also for adv. use atiriva, ativiya atīva.
