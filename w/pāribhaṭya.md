(& der.) “petting (or spoiling) the children” (*Mil trsl.* ii.287) but perhaps more likely “fondness of being petted” or “nurture (as *Vism trsl.* 32) (being carried about like on the lap or the back of a nurse, as expln at Vism.28 = Vb\-a.483) The readings are different, thus we find *\-bhaṭyatā* at Vb.240; Vb\-a.338, Vb\-a.483; *\-bhatyatā* at Vism.17, Vism.23 Vism.27 (vv.ll. *\-bhaṭṭatā* & ˚bbhaṭṭatā); *\-bhaṭṭakatā* at Mil.370; *\-bhaṭṭatā* at Vb.352; Kp\-a.236; Cnd.39. The more det. expln at Vb\-a.338 is “alankāra\-karaṇ ādīhi dāraka\-kīḷāpanaṃ etaṃ adhivacanaṃ.”\-See stock phrase under *mugga\-sūpyatā*.
