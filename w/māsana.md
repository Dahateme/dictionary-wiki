Māsati, Māsana, Māsin

■ dumapakkāni *\-māsita* Ja.ii.446 (C. reads māsita & explains by asita, dhāta); visa\-māsita Mil.302 (T. reads visamāsita) having taken in poison; visa\- *māsan\-* ûpatāpa (id.) Vism.166; tiṇa *\-māsin* eating grass Ja.vi.354 (= tiṇakhādaka C.)  
■ A similar case where Sandhi\-m\-has led to a wrong partition of syllables and has thus been lost through syncope may be P. eḷaka1, as compd with Sk. methi (cp. Prk. meḍhi), pillar, post.

fr. *mṛṣ*, for massati etc.; see *[masati](masati.md)*| touch, touching, etc. in sense of eating or taking in. So is probably to be read for āsati etc. in the foll. passages, where *m* precedes this *[ā](ā.md)* in all cases Otherwise we have to refer them to a root *ās = as* (to eat) and consider the *m* as partly euphonic.
