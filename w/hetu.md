1. cause, reason, condition SN.i.134; AN.iii.440 sq.; Dhs.595, Dhs.1053; Vism.450 Tikp.11, Kp.233, Kp.239. In the older use *[paccaya](paccaya.md)* and *[hetu](hetu.md)* are almost identical as synonyms, e.g. n’atthi hetu n’atthi paccayo DN.i.53; aṭṭha hetū aṭṭha paccayā DN.iii.284 sq.; cp. SN.iii.69 sq.; DN.ii.107; MN.i.407; AN.i.55 sq., AN.i.66, AN.i.200; AN.iv.151 sq.; but later they were differentiated (see Mrs. Rh. D., Tikp introd. p. xi. sq.). The diff. between the two is explained e.g. at Ne.78 sq.; Dhs\-a.303  
   ■ There are a number of other terms, with which *[hetu](hetu.md)* is often combined, apparently without distinction in meaning, e.g. hetu paccaya kāraṇa Cnd.617 (s. v. sankhā); mūla h. nidāna sambhava pabhava samuṭṭhāna āhāra ārammaṇa paccaya samudaya frequent in the Niddesa (see Cnd.p.231, s. v. mūla). In the *Abhidhamma* we find hetu as “moral condition referring to the 6 *mūlas* or bases of good & bad kamma viz.; *lobha, dosa, moha* and their opposites: Dhs.1053 sq. Kv.532 sq  
   ■ *Four* kinds of hetu are distinguished at Dhs\-a.303 = Vb\-a.402, viz. hetu˚, paccaya˚, uttama˚ sādhāraṇa˚. Another 4 at Tikp.27, viz. kusala˚ akusala˚, vipāka˚, kiriya˚, and 9 at Tikp.252, viz kusala˚, akusala˚, avyākata˚, in 3 × 3 constellations (cp Dhs\-a.303)  
   ■ On term in detail see *Cpd.* 279 sq.; *Dhs translation* §§ 1053, 1075  
   ■ abl. *[hetuso](hetuso.md)* from or by way of (its) cause SN.v.304; AN.iii.417  
   ■ acc. *[hetu](hetu.md)* (\-˚) (elliptically as adv.) on account of, for the sake of (with gen.) e.g. dāsa\-kammakara\-porisassa hetu MN.ii.187; *kissa hetu* why? AN.iii.303; AN.iv.393; Snp.1131; Pv.ii.8#1 (= kiṃ nimittaṃ Pv\-a.106); *pubbe kata˚*; by reason (or in consequence) of what was formerly done AN.i.173 sq.; *dhana˚* for the sake of gain Snp.122.
2. suitability for the attainment of Arahantship, one of the 8 conditions precedent to becoming a Buddha Bv.ii.59 = Ja.i.14, Ja.i.44.
3. logic Mil.3.

* *\-[paccaya](paccaya.md)* the moral causal relation, the first of the 24 Paccayas in the *Paṭṭhāna* Tikp.1 sq., Kp.23 sq., Kp.60 sq., Kp.287 , Kp.320; Duka\-pa.8, Kp.41 sq.; Vism.532; Vb\-a.174.
* *\-[pabhava](pabhava.md)* arising from a cause, conditioned Vin.i.40; Dhp\-a.i.92
* *\-[vāda](vāda.md)* the theory of cause, as adj. “proclaimer of a cause,” name of a sect MN.i.409; opp. *ahetu\-vāda* “denier of a cause” (see [a sect](a sect.md)) MN.i.408; *ahetu\-vādin* id. Ja.v.228 Ja.v.241 (= Jtm.149).
