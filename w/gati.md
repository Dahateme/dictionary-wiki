In later sources we find 6 divisions, viz. 1–3 as above, 4 asurā, 5 manussā 6 devā, of which 1–4 are comprised under apāyā (conditions of suffering, q.v.) or duggatiyo (see Pv.iv.11 cp. Pv\-a.103). These six also at DN.iii.264  
   ■ lokassa gatiṃ pajānāti Bhagavā Snp.377 (gati = nirayādipañcappabhedaṃ Snp\-a.368).
