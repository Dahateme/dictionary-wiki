Phuṭa1
1. (cp. pharati1) pervaded, permeated, thrilled (cp. pari˚) DN.i.73, DN.i.74 (pītisukhena T. prints phuta; variant reading phuṭa; variant reading at DN\-a.i.217 p(h)uṭṭha) MN.i.276; Ja.i.33 (sarīraṃ pītiyā ph.); Dhp\-a.ii.118 (pītiyā phuṭa\-sarīro); Snp\-a.107 (referring to the nerves of taste).
2. (cp. pharati2) expanded, spread out, spread with (instr.) Vin.i.182 (lohitena); Ja.v.266 (in niraya passage T. reads bhūmi yojana\-sataṃ phuṭā tiṭṭhanti i.e. the beings fill or are spread out over such a space; C. 272 explains by “ettakaṃ ṭhānaṃ *anupharitvā* tiṭṭhanti.” The id. p. at Mnd.405 = Cnd.304#iii d reads bh. yojana\-sataṃ *[pharitvā](pharitvā.md)* (intrs.: expanding, wide) tiṭṭhati, which is the more correct reading)

 s. v. into *pūta*. The meaning is “filled with, spread with,” thus = phuṭa1, cp. sequence under ophuṭa. The variant reading at MN.i.377 is puṭṭha. On miswriting of phuṭṭa puṭṭha for phuṭa cp. remark by Trenckner, MN.i.553 A similar meaning (“full of, occupied by, overflowing with”) is attached to phuṭa in *Avīci* passage AN.i.159 (Avīci maññe phuṭo ahosi), cp. Anāgata Vaṃsa (*J.P.T.S.* 1886, v.39) & remarks of Morris’s; *J.P.T.S.* 1887, 165. The same passage as MN.i.377 is found at DN.i.57 where T. reads *phuṭṭa* (as also at DN\-a.i.168), with vv. ll puṭṭha & phuṭa.
