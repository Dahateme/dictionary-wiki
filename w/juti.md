effulgence; brightness; splendor.

dict_label = "PTS"
word = "juti"
summary = "splendour, brightness, effulgence, light Ja.ii.353"

```

splendour, brightness, effulgence, light Ja.ii.353; Pv\-a.122, Pv\-a.137, Pv\-a.198. The spelling juti at MN.i.328 (in combination gati \+ juti) seems to be faulty for cuti (so as variant reading given on p. 557).

* *\-[dhara](dhara.md)* (jutinËš) carrying or showing light, shining resplendent, brilliant SN.i.121; Ja.ii.353; Dhp\-a.i.432.

Sk. jyuti & dyuti, to dyotate, see *[jotati](jotati.md)*
