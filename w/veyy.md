Veyy˚

is a (purely phonetic) diaeretic form of *[vy˚](vy˚.md)*; for which *viy˚ & veyy˚;* are used indiscriminately. There is as little difference between *viy˚ & veyy˚;* as between *vi˚ & ve˚;* in those cases where (double, as it were abstract nouns are formed from words with *[ve˚](ve˚.md)*; (vepullatā, vemattatā, etc.), which shows that *[ve˚](ve˚.md)*; was simply felt as *vi˚*. Cp. the use of e for i (esp. before y) in cases like alabbhaneyya → ˚iya; addhaneyya → ˚iya; pesuṇeyya → ˚iya, without any difference in meaning.
