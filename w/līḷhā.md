grace, ease, charm adroitness; always used with ref. to the *Buddha* (Buddhalīḷhā), e.g. Ja.i.155; Dhp\-a.i.33; Dhp\-a.iii.79. So in phrase *Buddhalīḷhāya dhammaṃ deseti* “to expound the doctrine with the Buddha’s mastery” Ja.i.152, Ja.i.155 Ja.iii.289; Vv\-a.217 (spelling wrongly līḷāya). Of the B’s gait: Ja.i.93, Ja.i.149; Dhp\-a.ii.41. The combination with *[vilāsa](vilāsa.md)*, as mentioned by Childers, applies to *[līlā](līlā.md)* (q.v.) which may stand for *[līḷhā](līḷhā.md)* at the passages mentioned although not used of the Buddha.

abstr. of līḷha, Sk. līḍha, pp. of *lih*, lit. being polished, cp. ullīḍha polished
