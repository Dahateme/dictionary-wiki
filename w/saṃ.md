Saṃ˚

indeclinable prefix, implying conjunction & completeness; *[saṃ˚](saṃ˚.md)*; is after *vi˚*; (19') the most frequent (16') of all Pāli prefixes. Its primary meaning is “together” (cp. Lat. con˚); hence arises that of a closer connection or a more accentuated action than that expressed by the simple verb (intensifying = thoroughly quite), or noun. Very often merely pleonastic, esp. in combination with other prefixes (e.g. sam\-anu˚, sam\-ā˚ sam\-pa˚). In meaning of “near by, together” it is opposed to *para˚*; as modifying prefix it is contrary to *abhi˚*; and (more frequently) to *vi˚*; (e.g. saṃvadati → vivadati), whereas it often equals *[pa˚](pa˚.md)*; (e.g. pamodati → sammodati), with which it is often combined as *sampa˚* and also *abhi˚*; (e.g. abhivaḍḍhati → saṃvaḍḍhati), with which often combined as *abhisaṃ˚*  
■ Bdhgh & Dhpāla explain; *[saṃ˚](saṃ˚.md)*; by *[sammā](sammā.md)* (Snp\-a.151; Kp\-a.209: so read for samā āgatā), *[suṭṭhu](suṭṭhu.md)* (see e.g. santasita, santusita) or *[samantā](samantā.md)* (= altogether; Snp\-a.152, Snp\-a.154), or (dogmatically) *sakena santena samena* (Kp\-a.240), or as “*[saṃyoga](saṃyoga.md)*” Vism.495  
■ In combination with y we find both *saṃy˚*; and *[saññ˚](saññ˚.md)*. The usual conṭracted form before *r* is *sā˚*.

prefix; Idg. *\*sem* one; one & the same, cp. Gr.; ὁμαλός even, α ̔́μα at one, ὁμός together; Sk. sama even, the same; samā in the same way; Av. hama same = Goth. sama, samap together; Lat. simul (= simultaneous), similis “re\-sembling.” Also Sk. sa (= sa2 together = Gr. ἁ ἀ\-(e.g. α ̓́κοιτις); Av. ha\-; and samyak towards *one* point = P. *[sammā](sammā.md)*  
■ Analogously to Lat semel “once,” simul, we find *sa˚*; as *numeral* base for “one” in Vedic sakṛt “once” = P. *sakid* (& sakad) sahasra 1000 = P.; *[sahassa](sahassa.md)*, and in adv. *[sadā](sadā.md)* “always, lit. “in one”
