? in phrase “akkhīni upacciṃsu” at Ja.vi.187 is probably faulty for *apaciyiṃsu* aor. of apaciyyati, Pass of apacināti (cp. upaciyyati → upacināti) “the eyes failed” lost power, went bad; cp. apacaya falling off, diminution If not this reading we should suggest *upacchijjiṃsu* from upacchindati “were destroyed”, which however is not quite the sense wanted.
