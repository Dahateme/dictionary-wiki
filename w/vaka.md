Vaka1

wolf, only in *poetry* Snp.201; Ja.i.336; Ja.ii.450; Ja.v.241, Ja.v.302.

Vedic vṛka, Idg. \*ṷI̊qṷo = Lat. lupus, Gr. λύκος, Lith. vilkas, Goth. wulfs = E. wolf etc.

Vaka2

indeclinable : a root *vak* is given at Dhtp.7 & Dhtm.8 in meaning “ādāne,” i.e. grasping, together with a root *kuk* as synonym. It may refer to vaka1 wolf, whereas *kuk* would explain *[koka](koka.md)* wolf. The notion of voraciousness is prevalent in the characterization of the wolf (see all passages of vaka1, e.g. Ja.v.302).
