3rd sg. aor. of chindati “he has cut out or broken, has destroyed” (see also *[chindati](chindati.md)* 3) in combn. with *taṇhaṃ* MN.i.122; SN.i.12, SN.i.23, SN.i.127 (so read for acchejja); SN.iv.105, SN.iv.207. Iti.47; AN.iii.246, AN.iii.445; Dhp\-a.iv.70 (gloss acchindi, for acchidda pret. of Dhp.351). The variant reading at all passages is *acchejji*, which is to be accounted for on graphological grounds, ch & j being substituted in MSS. Kern (Toevoegselen s. v.) mistakes the form tries to explain acchejji as adj. = ati\-ejin (ejā), acchecchi ati\-icchin (icchā). The syntactical construction however clearly points to an aor.
