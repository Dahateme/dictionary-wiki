Pātimokkha (pāti)˚

neuter a name given to a collection of various precepts contained in the Vinaya (forming the foundation of the Suttavibhanga, Vin vols. iii & iv. ed. Oldenberg), as they were recited on Uposatha days for the purpose of confession. See Geiger, *P. Lit.* c. 7, where literature is given; & cp.; *Vin. Texts* i.27 sq. Franke, *Dighanikāya* p. 66 sq.; \- *pāṭimokkhaṃ uddisati* to recite the P. Vin.i.102, Vin.i.112, Vin.i.175; Vin.ii.259; Vin.iii.8 Vin.iv.143; Ud.51; opp. *\-ṃ ṭhapeti* to suspend the (recital of the) P. Vin.ii.240 sq

with Childers plausibly as paṭi \+ mokkha, grd. of *muc* (Caus. mokṣ˚) with lengthening of paṭi as in other grd. like pāṭidesaniya. Thus in reality the same as paṭimokkha 2 in sense of binding, obligatory obligation, cp. Ja.v.25. The spelling is freq. pāti (BB pāṭi˚). The Sk. prāṭimokṣa is a wrong adaptation fr. P. pātimokkha, it should really be pratimokṣya “that which should be made binding.” An expln of the word after the style of a popular etym. is to be found at Vism.16
