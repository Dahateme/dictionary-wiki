the end—

1. *of space:* the extreme part, top, summit, point (cp. *[anta](anta.md)* to which it is opposed at Ja.vi.371): dhanu\-koṭiṃ nissāya “through the (curved) end of my bow,” i.e. by means of hunting Ja.ii.200; aṭṭhi\-koṭi the tip of the bone Ja.iii.26; cāpa a bow Vv\-a.261; vema˚ the part of a loom that is moved Dhp\-a.iii.175; khetta˚ the top (end) of the field Snp\-a.150 cankamana˚ the far end of the cloister Ja.iv.30; Pv\-a.79
2. *of time:* a division of time, with reference either to the past or the future, in *pubba˚*; the past (cp pubbanta), also as *purima˚*; and *pacchima˚*; the future (cp. aparanta). These expressions are used only of *[saṃsāra](saṃsāra.md)*: saṃsārassa purimā koṭi na paññāyati “the first end, i.e. the beginning of S. is not known” Cnd.664; Dhs\-a.11; of pacchimā koṭi ibid  
   ■ anamatagg âyaṃ saṃsāro, pubba˚ na paññāyati S’s end and beginning are unthinkable, its starting\-point is not known (to beings obstructed by ignorance) SN.ii.178 = SN.iii.149 Cnd.664 = Kv.29 = Pv\-a.166; cp. Bdhd 118 (p.k. na ñāyati)

3. *of number:* the “end” of the scale, i.e. extremely high, as numeral representing approximately the figure a hundred thousand (cp Kirfel, *Kosmographie.* p. 336). It follows on satasahassāni Cnd.664, and is often increased by sata˚ or sahassa˚, esp. in records of wealth (dhana) Snp.677; Ja.i.227, Ja.i.230, Ja.i.345 = Dhp\-a.i.367 (asīti˚\-vibhavo); Ja.i.478; Pv\-a.3, Pv\-a.96; cp. also koṭisatā arahanto Mil.6, Mil.18\-kahāpaṇa\-koṭi\-santhārena “for the price (lit. by the spreading out) of 10 million kahāpaṇas” Vin.ii.159; Ja.i.94 (ref. to the buying of Jetavana by Anāthapiṇḍika).
