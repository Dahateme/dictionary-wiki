light, splendour; given as name of a jewel at an extremely doubtful passage Ja.v.317, Ja.v.318, where T. reads “vara taṃ bhañ ñam icchasi,” & C. explains.: “bhā ti ratanass’ etaṃ nāmaṃ.” The variant reading for bhaññaṃ is bhuñjaṃ; the passage may be corrupt from “varatu bhavaṃ yam icchasi.”

cp. Vedic bhā & bhāḥ nt.
