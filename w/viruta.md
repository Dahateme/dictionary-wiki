noise, sound (of animals), cry Snp.927; explained as “virudaṃ [spelling with d, like ruda for ruta] vuccati\-miga\-cakkaṃ; miga\-cakka\-pāthakā [i.e. experts in the ways of animals; knowers of auspices migacakkaṃ ādisanti” at Mnd.382; and as “mig’ ādīnaṃ vassitaṃ” at Snp\-a.564. The passage is a little doubtful when we compare the expression *viruṭañ ca gabbhakaraṇaṃ* at Snp.927 with the passage *viruddha\-gabbhakaraṇaṃ* at DN.i.11 (cp. DN\-a.i.96), which seems more original.
