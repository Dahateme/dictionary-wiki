at Ja.iv.184 appears to be a misreading for *codāya* (ger. from *[codeti](codeti.md)*) in meaning *iṇaṃ codeti* to undertake a loan, to lend money at interest (= vaḍḍhiyā inaṃ payojetvā C.), to demand payment for a loan. The variant reading at all places is *codāya* (= codetvā). See *[codeti](codeti.md)*.
