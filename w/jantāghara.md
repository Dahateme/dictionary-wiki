1. a (hot room for bathing purposes, a sitzbath Vin.i.47, Vin.i.139 Vin.ii.119, Vin.ii.220 sq., Vin.ii.280; Vin.iii.55; MN.iii.126; Ja.ii.25, Ja.ii.144 Vism.18; Dpvs.viii.45.
2. living room Ja.i.449.

acc. to Abhp. 214 = aggisālā, a room in which a fire is kept (viz. for the purpose of a steam bath, i.e. a hot room, cp. in meaning Mhg. kemenate = Lat. caminata Ger. stube = E. stove; Low Ger. pesel (room) Lat. pensile (bath) etc.) Etym. uncertain. Bühler *KZ* 25, p. 325 = yantra\-gṛha (oil\-mill?); E. Hardy (*D. Lit. Ztg.* 1902, p. 339) = jentāka (hot dry bath), cp *Vin. Texts* i.157; iii.103. In all probability it is a distorted form (by dissimilation or analogy), perhaps of \*jhānt\-āgāra, to *jhā* to burn = Sk. kṣā, jhānti heat or heating (= Sk. kṣāti) \+ āgāra, which latter received the aspiration of the first part (= āghāra), both being reduced in length of vowels = jant\-āghara
