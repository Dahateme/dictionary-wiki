Sakaṭa1

masculine & neuter a cart, waggon; a cartload DN.ii.110; Vin.iii.114; Ja.i.191; Mil.238; Pv\-a.102; Vb\-a.435 (simile of two carts); Snp\-a.58 (udaka\-bharita˚), Snp\-a.137 (bīja˚). *sakaṭāni pajāpeti* to cause the carts to go on Ja.ii.296.

* *\-[gopaka](gopaka.md)* the guardian of the waggon Dhp\-a.iv.60
* *\-[bhāra](bhāra.md)* a cart\-load Vv\-a.79.
* *\-[mukha](mukha.md)* the front or opening of the waggon, used as adj. “facing the waggon or the cart” (?) at DN.ii.234, of the earth\-that is, India as then known\-and at DN.ii.235 (comp. Mahāvastu iii.208), of six kingdoms in Northern India. At the second passage B. explains that the six kingdoms all debouched alike on the central kingdom, which was hexagonal in shape. This explanation does not fit the other passage. Could *[sakaṭa](sakaṭa.md)* there be used of the constellation Rohinī, which in mediaeval times was called the Cart? Cp. *Dial.* ii.269.
