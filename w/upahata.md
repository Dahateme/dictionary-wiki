injured, spoilt; destroyed DN.i.86 (phrase khata \+ upahata); SN.i.238 (na sûpahata “not easily put out” trsl.); SN.ii.227; AN.i.161; Dhp.134; Ja.vi.515; Mil.223, Mil.302; Dhp\-a.ii.33 (an˚).

The formula at DN.i.86 (khata \+ upahata) is doubtful as to its exact meaning According to Bdhgh it means “one who has destroyed his foundation of salvation, i.e. one who cannot be saved. Thus at DN\-a.i.237: “bhinna\-patiṭṭho jāto, i.e. without a basis. Cp. remarks under khata. The translation at *Dial.* i.95 gives it as “deeply affected and touched in heart”: doubtful. The phrase *upahaccaparinibbāyin* may receive light from *[upahata](upahata.md)*.
