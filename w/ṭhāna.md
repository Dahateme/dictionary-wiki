### IV. *Contrasted with negation of term* ###

(ṭhāna & aṭṭhāna) The meanings in this category are restricted to those mentioned above under I esp. 1 (a) & 2 (d, viz. the relations of place → not place (or wrong place, also as proper time & wrong time), i.e. somewhere → nowhere and of possibility → impossibility (truth → falsehood)

1. ṭhānaṃ upagacchati (pathaviyā) to find a (resting place on the ground, to stay on the ground (by means of the law of attraction and gravitation) Mil.255; opp. na ṭhānaṃ upa˚ to find no place to rest, to go into nothingness Mil.180, Mil.237, Mil.270
2. ṭhānaṃ vijjati there is a reason, it is logically sound, it is possible DN.i.163 DN.i.175; MN.iii.64; Pts.ii.236 sq.; cp. Mhvs.ii.448; opp na etaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati it is not possible, feasible, plausible logically correct Vin.ii.284; DN.i.104, DN.i.239; MN.ii.10 MN.iii.64; Mil.237; Ne.92 sq
3. *aṭṭhānaṃ* an impossibility Snp.54 (aṭṭhāna, with elision of ṃ); aṭṭhāne at the wrong time Ja.i.256; ṭhāna is that one of the gatis which is accessible to human influence, as regards gifts of relief or sacrifice (this is the pettivisaya), whilst aṭṭhāna applied to the other 4 gatis (see *[gati](gati.md)*) Pv\-a.27 sq. In cpd. *ṭhānāṭhāna\-gata* it means referring or leading to good & bad places (gatis): of sabbe khayadhammā (i.e. keci saggûpagā keci apāyûpagā) Ne.94 In combn apucchi nipuṇe pañhe ṭhānâṭhānagate (Mil.1) it may mean either questions concerning possibilities & impossibilities or truths & falsehoods, or questions referring to happy & unhappy states (of existence); ṭhānâṭhāna\-ñāṇa is “knowledge of correct & faulty conclusions” Ne.94, cp. Kv.231 sq.; the same combination occurs with ˚kusala ˚kusalatā “accomplished or skilled (& skill) in understanding correct or faulty conclusions” DN.iii.212 (one of the ten powers of the Buddha); MN.iii.64; Dhs.1337, Dhs.1338 (trsl. by Mrs Rh. D. on p. 348 *Dhs. trsl.* as “skill in affirming or negating causal conjuncture”). In the same sense ṭhānaṃ ṭhānato pajānāti (& aṭṭhānaṃ aṭṭhānato p.) to draw a logical inference from that which is a proper ground for inference (i.e. which is logical) SN.v.304; MN.i.69 sq. = AN.iii.417; AN.v.33.

* *\-[uppatti](uppatti.md)* arising instantaneously (see ṭhānaso, above III.) Vv\-a.37; Ja.vi.308 (˚kāraṇavindana finding a means right on the spot); *\-ka* (adj.) on the spot, momentary spontaneous Ja.vi.304.
