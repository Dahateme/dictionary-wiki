### I. *Relation between ava & o* ###

Phonetically the difference between ava & o is this, that; *ava* is the older form, whereas *[o](o.md)* represents a later development. Historically the case is often reversed\-that is, the form in o was in use first & the form in ava was built up, sometimes quite independently, long afterwards.; *Okaḍḍhati okappati, okappanā, okassati, okāra, okantati, okkamati ogacchati, odāta* and others may be used as examples The difference in many cases has given rise to a differentiation of meaning, like E. ripe: rife, quash: squash Ger. Knabe: Knappe etc. (see below B 2)

1. The old Pāli form of the prefix is *[o](o.md)*. In same cases however a Vedic form in ava has been preserved by virtue of its archaic character. In words forming the 2nd part of a cpd. we have ava, while the absolute form of the same word has o. See e.g. avakāsa (\-˚) → okāsa (˚\-); avacara → ocaraka; avatata; avadāta; avabhāsa; avasāna
2. The proportion in the words before us (early and later is that *[o](o.md)* alone is found in 65% of all cases, *ava* alone in 24%, and *ava* as well as *[o](o.md)* in 11%. The proportion of forms in *ava* increases as the books or passages become later. Restricted to the older literature (the 4 Nikāyas) are the foll. forms with o: okiri, okkanti, okkamati okkhipati, ogacchati, ossajati
   1. The Pāli form (o˚ shows a differentiation in meaning against the later Sanskrit forms (*[ava˚](ava˚.md)*;). See the foll.:  
      avakappanā harnessing: okappanā confidence;  
      avakkanti (not Sk.): okkanti appearance;  
      avakkhitta thrown down: okkhitta subdued;  
      avacara sphere of motion: ocaraka spy;  
      avatiṇṇa descended: otiṇṇa affected with love;  
      avaharati to move down, put off: oharati to steal.
   2. In certain secondary verb\-formations, arisen on Pāli grounds, the form o˚ is used almost exclusively pointing thus to a clearly marked dialectical development of Pali. Among these formations are *Diminutives* in ˚ka usually; the *Gerund* & the; *Infinitive* usually; the *Causatives* throughout.

#### Affinities of ava ####

1. *apa*. There exists an exceedingly frequent interchange of forms with apa˚ and ava˚ the historical relation of which has not yet been thoroughly investigated. For a comparison of the two the BSk. forms are indispensable, and often afford a clue as to the nature of the word in question. See on this *apa 2* and cp. the foll. words under ava: avakata, ˚karoti, ˚khalita, ˚anga ottappa, avattha, ˚nīta, ˚dāna, ˚pivati, ˚rundhati, ˚lekhati ˚vadati, ˚varaka, ˚sakkati, avassaya, avasseti, ˚hita, avāpurīyati avekkhati
2. *abhi*. The similarity between abhi & ava is seen from a comparison of meaning abhi; ii. b and ava ii. a. The two prefixes are practically synonymous in the foll. words: ˚kankhati, ˚kamati, ˚kiṇṇa ˚khipati, ˚maddati, ˚rata, ˚lambati, ˚lekheti, ˚lepana ˚siñcati
3. The contrary of ava is *ut* (cp. above ii.2) Among the freq. contrast\-pairs showing the two, like E up & down, are the foll. ukkaṃsâvakaṃsa, uggaman\-oggamana, uccâvaca, ullangheti\-olangheti, ullittâvalitta; ogilituṃuggilituṃ onaman\-unnamana. Two other combns. founded on the same principle (of intensifying contrast) are chiddâvacchidda and ava˚ in contrast with vi˚ in olambavilamba olugga\-vilugga.

P. ava = Vedic *ava* & occasionally o Av. ava; Lat. au\-(aufero = avabharati, aufugio etc.) Obg. u\-; Oir. ō, ua. See further relations in Walde, Lat Wtb. under au
