at MN.i.518 is unexplained. The reading of this word is extremely doubtful at all passages. The vv ll. at MN.i.518 are pavudhā, pavujā, paṭuvā, \*phutā, and the C. expln is pavuṭā = *[gaṇṭhikā](gaṇṭhikā.md)* (knot or block?). The identical passage at DN.i.54 reads *paṭuvā* (q.v.), with vv.ll. pamuṭā, pamuvucā, while DN\-a.i.164 explains *pacuṭā* = gaṇṭhikā (vv.ll. pamuṭā, pamucā, papuṭā). *Dial.* i.72 reads *[pacuṭa](pacuṭa.md)*, but leaves the word untranslated Franke, *Dīgha*, p. 58 ditto.
