1. basket Vin.i.225 (ghaṭa p. ucchanga), Vin.i.240 (catudoṇika p.); Pv.iv.3#33; Vism.28 (piṭake nikkhitta\-loṇa\-maccha\-phāla\-sadisaṃ phaṇaṃ); *dhañña˚* a grain\-basket Dhp\-a.iii.370; *vīhi˚*; a rice basket Dhp\-a.iii.374. Usually in combination *kuddāḷa\-piṭaka* “hoe and basket,” wherever the act of digging is referred to e.g. Vin.iii.47; DN.i.101; MN.i.127; SN.ii.88; SN.v.53; AN.i.204; AN.ii.199; Ja.i.225, Ja.i.336; DN\-a.i.269.
2. (fig.) t.t for the 3 main divisions of the Pāli Canon “the three baskets (basket as container of tradition Winternitz *Ind. Lit.* ii.8; cp. peḷā 2) of oral tradition,” viz. *Vinaya˚ Suttanta˚, Abhidhamma˚*; thus mentioned by name at Pv\-a.2; referred to as “tayo piṭakā” at Ja.i.118 Vism.96 (pañca\-nikāya\-maṇḍale tīṇi piṭakāni parivatteti), Vism.384 (tiṇṇaṃ Vedānaṃ uggahaṇaṃ, tiṇṇaṃ Piṭakānaṃ uggahaṇaṃ); Snp\-a.110, Snp\-a.403; Dhp\-a.iii.262 Dhp\-a.iv.38; cp. Divy.18, Divy.253, Divy.488. With ref. to the Vinaya mentioned at Vin.v.3  
   ■ *Piṭaka* is a later collective appellation of the Scriptures; the first division of the Canon (based on *oral* tradition entirely) being into *Sutta* and *Vinaya* (i.e. the stock paragraphs learnt by heart, and the rules of the Order). Thus described at DN.ii.124; cp. the expression *bhikkhu suttantika vinayadhara* Vin.ii.75 (earlier than *tepiṭaka* or *[piṭakadhara](piṭakadhara.md)*) Independently of this division we find the designation “Dhamma” applied to the doctrinal portions; and out of *this* developed the 3rd Piṭaka, the *Abhidhammap*. See also Dhamma C.1  
   ■ The Canon as *we* have it comes very near in language and contents to the canon as established at the 3rd Council in the time of King Asoka. The latter was in Māgadhī  
   ■ The knowledge of the 3 Piṭakas as an accomplishment of the bhikkhu is stated in the term *tepīṭaka* “one who is familiar with the 3 P.” (thus at Mil.18; Dāvs v.22; Kp\-a.41 with variant reading ti˚; Snp\-a.306 id.; Dhp\-a.iii.385). *tipetakī* (Vin.v.3 Khemanāma t.), *[tipeṭaka](tipeṭaka.md)* (Mil.90), and *tipiṭaka\-dhara* Kp\-a.91. See also below *\-ttaya*. In BSk. we find the term *trepiṭaka* in early inscriptions (1st century a.d, see e.g. Vogel, Epigraphical discoveries at Sārnāth, *Epigraphia Indica* viii. p. 173, 196; Bloch, *J. As. Soc Bengal* 1898, 274, 280); the term *tripiṭaka* in literary documents (e.g. Divy.54), as also *tripiṭa* (e.g. Avs.i.334; Divy.261, Divy.505)  
   ■ On the Piṭakas in general the origin of the P. Canon see Oldenberg, in ed. of Vin.1; and Winternitz, *Gesch. d. Ind. Litt.* 1913, ii.1 sq. iii.606, 635  
   ■ Cp. *[peṭaka](peṭaka.md)*.

* *\-ttaya* the triad of the Piṭakas or holy Scriptures Snp\-a.328.
* *\-[dhara](dhara.md)* one who knows (either one or two or all three) the Piṭaka by heart, as *eka˚, dvi˚, ti˚*; at Vism.62, Vism.99.
* *\-sampadāya* according to the P. tradition or on the ground of the authority of the P. MN.i.520 (itihītiha etc.); MN.ii.169 (id.); and in exegesis of *itikirā* (hearsay\-tradition) at AN.i.189 = AN.ii.191 = Cnd.151.
