2. tabulation, register, tabulated summary, condensed contents, esp. of philosophical parts of the Canonical books in the Abhidhamma; used in Vinaya in place of Abhidhamma Piṭaka; probably the original form of that (later) Piṭaka Vin.i.119, Vin.i.337; Vin.ii.8 [cp semantically in similar sense Lat. mātrix = E. matric i.e. register. In BSḳ. mātrikā Divy.18, Divy.333] AN.i.117 (Dhamma\-dhara, Vinaya\-dhara, Mātikā\-dhara; here equivalent to Abhidhamma); Vism.312 (so pañcavasso hutvā dve mātikā paguṇaṃ katvā pavāretvā) Snp\-a.15; Kp\-a.37, Kp\-a.99, Kp\-a.117.

* *\-[nikkhepa](nikkhepa.md)* putting down of a summary, tabulation Vism.536, Vism.540. The summary itself is sometimes called *[nikkhepa](nikkhepa.md)*, e.g. the 4th part of the Atthasālinī (Dhs\-a.343–Dhs\-a.409) is called *nikkhepa\-kaṇḍa* or chapter of the summary; similarly *m\- nikkhepa vāra* at Tikp. 11.
