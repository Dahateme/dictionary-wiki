# luta

``` toml
dict_label = "PTS"

summary = "seems to be a legitimate spelling representing eit"
see_also = ["lutta", "lūna"]
```

seems to be a legitimate spelling representing either *[lutta](lutta.md)* or *[lūna](lūna.md)*, in meaning “cut, cut off”. Thus at SN.i.5 (nalo va harito luto), SN.i.126 = Ja.vi.25; and at Snp.532 (lutāni bandhanāni; vv. ll lūtāni & lunāni; explained as “chinnāni padālitāni” at Snp\-a.432).

cp. *lu* for *lū* under lunāti
