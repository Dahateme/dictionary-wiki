kind of kidney\-bean, Phaseolus mungo, freq. combined with *māsa2* (q.v.). On its size (larger than sāsapa smaller than kalāya) see AN.v.170 & cp. kalāya

* *\-[sūpa](sūpa.md)* bean\-soup Vism.27.
* *\-sūpyatā* “bean\-soup character,” or as *Vism trsl.* 32 has it “bean\-curry talk”; fig. denoting a faulty character, i.e. a man who behaves like bean\-soup. The metaphor is not quite transparent; it is explained by Bdhgh as meaning a man speaking half\-truths, as in a soup of beans some are only half\-boiled. The expln is forced, & is stereotype; as well as is the combination in which it occurs. Its origin remains to be elucidated. Anyhow it refers to an unevenness in character, a flaw of character. The passage (with var. spellings) is always the foll.: *[cāṭukamyatā](cāṭukamyatā.md)* (pātu˚ Cnd; ˚kammatā Miln; pāṭu˚ Vb *mugga\-sūpyatā* (˚sūpatā Cnd; ˚suppatā Mil & Kp\-a.236; ˚sūpatā and suppatā Vb & Vb\-a.338; supyatā Vism) *pāribhaṭṭatā* (˚bhatyatā Vism.; ˚bhaṭṭakatā Miln; ˚bhaṭyatā & ˚bbhaṭṭatā Vb). At Cnd.391 it is used to explain *sāvajja\- bhogin*, at Vism.17 & Vb.246; *[anācāra](anācāra.md)*; at Vb.352 *[lapanā](lapanā.md)*; at Mil.370 it is used generally (cp. *Mil trsl.* ii.287). The C. expln of the Vb passage, as given at (Vb\-a.483 &) Vism.17 runs as follows: “mugga\-sūpa\-samānāya sacc’ âlikena jīvita kappanatāy’ etaṃ adhivacanaṃ. Yathā hi muggasūpe paccante bahū muggā pākaṃ gacchanti, thokā na gacchanti, evam eva saccâlikena jīvitakappake puggale bahuṃ alikaṃ hoti, appakaṃ saccaṃ.” The text at Vb\-a.483 is slightly different, although the sense is the same. Similarly at Vism.27.
