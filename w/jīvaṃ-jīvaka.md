Jīvaṃ\-jīvaka

(m. onom.) name of a bird, a sort of pheasant (or partridge?), which utters a note sounding like jīvaṃ jīva DN.iii.201; Ja.v.406, Ja.v.416; Ja.vi.276, Ja.vi.538. With this cp. the Jain phrase jīvaṃjīveṇa gacchaï jīvaṃjīveṇaṃ ciṭṭhaï, Weber Bhagavatī pp. 289, 290, with doubtful interpretation (“living he goes with life”? or “he goes like the j bird”?).

Fausböll reads jīvajīvaka in all the Jātaka passages. Speyer Avs.ii.227 has jīvañjīvaka
