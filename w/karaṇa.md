1. adj. (f. ī) (\-˚) doing, making, causing, producing; as cakkhu˚ ñāṇa˚ (leading to clear knowledge) SN.iv.331; SN.v.97; Iti.83; and acakkhu etc. SN.v.97; nāthā ˚ā dhammā AN.v.23 (cp. AN.v.89) and thera˚ AN.ii.22; dubbaṇṇa˚ SN.v.217; see also DN.i.245 MN.i.15; SN.v.96, SN.v.115; AN.iv.94; AN.v.268; Mil.289.

   3. ttg. the instrumental case (with or without *˚vacana*) Pv\-a.33; Vv\-a.25, Vv\-a.53, Vv\-a.162, Vv\-a.174. *\-atthe* in the sense of, with the meaning of the instrumental case Ja.iii.98; Ja.v.444; Pv\-a.35; Vv\-a.304; Dhs\-a.48; Kacc.157–Kacc.4. (\-˚) state, condition; in noun\-abstract function ˚ttaṃ (cp. kamma I.2) as nānā˚ (= nānattaṃ) difference MN.ii.128; SN.iv.294; Bdhd 94; kasi˚ ploughing Pv\-a.66 kattabba˚ (= kattabbattaṃ) “what is to be done, i.e. duty Pv\-a.30; pūjā˚ veneration Pv\-a.30. sakkāra reverence, devotion Snp\-a.284.

Note: in massu˚ and kamma˚ some grammarians have tried to derive k˚ from a root *kṛ*; to hurt, cut, torture (see Morris *J.P.T.S.* 1893, 15), which is however quite unnecessary (see *[kamma](kamma.md)* 3 Ab, kataii 1.) Karaṇa here stands for kamma, as clearly indicated by semantic grounds as well as by Ja.vi.270 where it explains kappita\-kesa\-massu, and Ja.v.309 & Dhp\-a.i.253 where massukamma takes the place of ˚karaṇa, and Ja.iii.314, where it is represented by massu\-kutti (C.: massukiriya). Cp. also DN\-a.i.137 a˚ Negative in all meanings of the positive, i.e. the non\-performing Ja.i.131; Ja.v.222; Ne.81; Pv\-a.59; Dhs\-a.127; non\-undertaking (of business) Ja.i.229; noncommission MN.i.93; abstaining from Dhs.299.
