1. being, becoming, condition, nature; very rarely by itself (only in later & C. literature, as e.g. Ja.i.295 thīnaṃ bhāvo, perhaps best to be translated as “women’s character,” taking bhāva = attabhāva); usually \-˚, denoting state or condition of, and representing an abstr. der. from the first part of the cpd. e.g. gadrabha˚ ʻasininity’ Ja.ii.109 Thus in connection with
   1. *adjectives:* *atthika˚*; state of need Pv\-a.120; *ūna˚*; depletion Snp\-a.463; *ekī˚*; loneliness Vism.34; *sithill˚*; (for sithila˚ in conn. with *kṛ bhū*) relaxation Vism.502
   2. *adverbs.* *upari˚*; high condition MN.i.45; *pātu˚*; appearance Snp.560; *vinā˚* difference Snp.588.
   3. *nouns & noun\-derivations:* *atta˚* individual state, life, character Snp.388 (= citta Snp\-a.374) *asaraṇa˚*; state of not remembering Dhp\-a.iii.121; *samaṇa˚* condition of a recluse Snp.551
   4. forms of *verbs:* *nibbatta˚*; fact of being reborn Dhp\-a.iii.121; *magg ārūḷha˚*; the condition of having started on one’s way Vv\-a.64; *baddha˚*; that he was bound; *suhita˚*; that they were well Ja.iv.279. The translation can give either a full sentence with “that it was” etc. (Vv\-a.64 “that he had started on his way”), or a phrase like “the fact or state of,” or use as an English abstract noun ending in *\-ness* (atthika\-bhāva needfulness, eki loneliness), *\-ion* (ūna˚ depletion, pātu˚ manifestation) *\-hood* (atta˚ selfhood), or *\-ship* (samaṇa˚ recluseship). Similarly in Com. style: sampayutta\- *bhāvo* (m.) Dhp\-a.iii.94, for \*sampayuttattaṃ (abstr.); bhākuṭikassa bhāvo = bhakuṭiyaṃ Vism.26; sovacassassa bhāvo sovacassatā Kp\-a.148; mittassa bh. = mettaṃ Kp\-a.248 Here sometimes *[bhava](bhava.md)* for *[bhāva](bhāva.md)*.

2. (in pregnant specifically *Buddhistic* sense) cultivation or production by thought, mental condition, esp. a set mental condition (see der. bhāvanā). Sometimes (restricted to Vin J) in sense “thinking of someone,” i.e. affection, love sentiment
   1. in combination *khanti, diṭṭhi, ruci, bhāva* at Vin.ii.205; Vin.iii.93; Vin.iv.3, Vin.iv.4
   2. in Jātaka passages Ja.v.237; Ja.vi.293 (bhāvaṃ karoti, with loc., to love)\- *[abhāva](abhāva.md)* (late, only in C. style) not being, absence want Pv\-a.25; abl. *abhāvato* through not being, in want of Pv\-a.9, Pv\-a.17
