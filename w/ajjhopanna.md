? only found in one stock phrase, viz. gathita (q.v.) mucchita ajjhopanna with ref. to selfishness, greed bonds of craving. The reading *[ajjhopanna](ajjhopanna.md)* is the lectio difficilior, but the accredited reading *[ajjhosāna](ajjhosāna.md)* seems to be clearer and to harmonize better with the cognate ajjhosita & ajjhosāna (n.) in the same context. The confusion between the two is old\-standing and hard to be accounted for. Trenckner under variant reading to MN.i.162 on p. 543 gives ajjhopanna as BB (= adhi\-opanna). The MSS. of Nd ii.clearly show ajjhopanna as inferior reading, which may well be attributable to the very frequent SS substitution of p for s (see Nd ii.Introd. xix.). Besides this mixture of vv.ll. with s and p there is another confusion between the vv.ll. *[ajjhāpanna](ajjhāpanna.md)* and *[ajjhopanna](ajjhopanna.md)* which adds to the complication of the case. However since the evidence of a better reading between these two preponderates for ajjhopanna we may consider the o as established and, with a little more clearness to be desired, may in the end decide for *[ajjhosāna](ajjhosāna.md)* (q.v.), which in this case would have been liable to change through analogy with ajjhāpanna, from which it took the ā and p. Cp. also ajjhosita. The foll. is a synopsis of readings as preferred or confused by the Ed. of the var. texts.
