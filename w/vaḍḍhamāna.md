at Dpvs.xi.33 is probably equivalent to *[vaḍḍhana](vaḍḍhana.md)* (6) in special sense at Mhvs.23, Mhvs.33, and designates a (pair of) special (ly costly) garment(s). One might think of meaning vaḍḍheti “to bid higher (at a sale),” as in Divy.403; Avs.i.36, and explain as “that which causes higher bidding,” i.e. very precious. The passage is doubtful. It may simply mean “costly” (belonging to nandiyāvaṭṭaṃ); or is it to be read as *vaṭṭamāna*?
