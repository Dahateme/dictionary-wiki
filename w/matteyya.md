Matteyya & metteyya

(adj.) reverential towards one’s mother, mother\-loving DN.iii.74; Pv.ii.7#18 (= mātu hita Pv\-a.104 variant reading mett˚). Spelling at DN.iii.72 is metteyya. It is difficult to decide about correct spelling, as metteyya is no doubt influenced by the foll. *[petteyya](petteyya.md)*, with which it is always combined.

fr. mātā, \*mātreyya → \*matteyya
