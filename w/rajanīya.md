adjective of the nature of rajas, i.e. leading to lust, apt to rouse excitement, enticing lustful.

1. As epithet of *[rūpa](rūpa.md)* (vedanā saññā etc.) SN.iii.79; also at DN.i.152 sq. (dibbāni *rupāni* passāmi piya\-rūpāni kām’ ûpasaṃhitāni rajanīyāni; & the same with; *saddāni*). In another formula (relating to the 5 kāmaguṇā): rūpā (saddā etc.) iṭṭhā kantā manāpā piyarūpā kām’ ûpasaṃhitā rajanīyā DN.i.245; MN.i.85. The expln of this passage at DN\-a.i.311 is: r. = rāgajanaka  
   ■ The expression *rajanīyā dhammā* “things (or thoughts) causing excitement” is contrasted with *vimocaniyā* dh. “that which leads to emancipation at AN.ii.196. The same takes the places of *lobhanīyā* dhammā in combination with *dosanīyā & mohanīyā* dh. at SN.iv.307; AN.ii.120; AN.iii.169. Another pair is mentioned at Ne.18, viz. r. dhammā and *pariyuṭṭhāniyā* dh.
2. In diff. connections it means simply “delightful lovely” and is e.g. an epithet of the *night.* So at Pv.iii.7#1, where the passage runs “yuvā rajanīye kāmaguṇehi sobhasi”: youthful thou shinest with the qualities of enjoyment in the enjoyable (night), which at Pv\-a.205 is explained in a twofold manner viz. first as “ramaṇīyehi rāguppatti\-hetu\-bhūtehi” (viz. kāmagunehi), referring to aN variant reading *rajanīyehi*, and then as “rajanī ti vā rattīsu, ye ti nipātamattaṃ” and “virocasi rattiyaṃ.” Thus rajanī is here taken directly as “night” (cp. Abhp.69)  
   ■ At Pv.iv.6#2 the passage runs “pamattā *rajaniyesu* kām’ assād’ âbhinandhino” i.e. not heeding the enjoyment of the taste of craving *at nights;* here as m. & not f  
   ■ The meaning “lovely is applied to sounds at Thag.1233 (sarena rajanīyena) Vv\-a.37 (r. nigghosa).
