one who is getting trained, dependent, a freed slave, villager subject. Only in compounds like *bhojisiyaṃ* [bhoja \+ isi ya = issariya] mastery over dependence, i.e. independence SN.i.44, SN.i.45; *bhojājānīya* a well\-trained horse, a thoroughbred Ja.i.178, Ja.i.179; *[bhojaputta](bhojaputta.md)* son of a villager Ja.v.165; *bhojarājā* head of a village (\-district) a subordinate king Snp.553 = Thag.823  
■ In the latter phrase however it may mean “wealthy” kings, or “titled kings (khattiyā bh\-r., who are next in power to and serve on a rājā cakkavatti). The phrase is best taken as *one*, viz. “the nobles, royal kings.” It may be a term for “vice\-kings” or substitute\-kings, or those who are successors of the king. The expln at Snp\-a.453 takes the three words as three diff. terms and places bhojā bhogiyā as a designation of a class or rank (= bhogga) Neumann in his translation of Sn has “Königstämme, kühn and stolz,” free but according to the sense. The phrase may in bhoja contain a local designation of the Bhoja princes (Name of a tribe), which was then taken as a special name for “king” (cp. Kaiser → Caesar, or Gr. βασιλεύς) With the wording “khattiyā bhoja\-rājāno anuyuttā bhavanti te” cp. MN.iii.173: “*paṭirājāno* te rañño cakkavattissa anuyuttā bhavanti,” and AN.v.22: “*kuḍḍarājāno*” in same phrase  
■ Mrs. Rh. D. at *Brethren*, p. 311, trsls “nobles and wealthy lords.”

lit. grd. of bhuñjati2, to be sorted out, to be raised from slavery; thus also meaning “dependence”, “training,” from *bhuj*, to which belongs bhujissa
