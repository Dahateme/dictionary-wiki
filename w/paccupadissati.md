``` toml

summary = "to accept, receive; or: to show, point out Ja.v.22"
```

to accept, receive; or: to show, point out Ja.v.221 (variant reading paccuttarissati to go through, perhaps preferable; C. on p. 225 explains by sampaṭicchissati).

reading uncertain; either paṭi \+ upadissati, or fut. of paṭi \+ upadisati, cp. upadaṃseti. It is not to be derived fr. ˚upadadāti
