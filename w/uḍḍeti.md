Uḍḍeti1

to fly up MN.i.364 (kāko maṃsapesiṃ ādāya uḍḍayeyya; vv.ll. ubbaḍaheyya, uyya dayeyya); Ja.v.256, Ja.v.368, Ja.v.417.

ud \+ ḍeti to fly. The etym. is doubtful, Müller P. Gr. 99 identifies uḍḍeti1 & uḍḍeti2 both as causatives to *ḍī*. Of uḍḍeti2 two forms exist, uḍḍ˚ & oḍḍ˚, the latter of which may be a variant of the former, but with specialisation of meaning (“lay snares”), it may be a cpd with ava˚ instead of ud˚. It is extremely doubtful whether uḍḍeti2 belongs here, we should rather separate it & refer it to another root, probably; *lī*, layate (as in allīna, nilīyati etc.), to stick to, adhere, fasten etc. The change l → ḍ is a freq. Pāli phenomenon. Another Caus. ii. of the same root *(ḍī?)* is uṭṭepeti

Uḍḍeti2
1. to bind up, tie up to, string up Vin.ii.131 (so read for uṭṭitvā, variant reading uḍḍhetvā)
2. to throw away, reject Pv\-a.256 (chaḍḍayāmi gloss)
