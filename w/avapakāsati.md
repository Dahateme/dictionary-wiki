is a doubtful compd. of kassati, the combd. ava \+ pa occurring only in this word. In all likelihood it is a distortion of *[vavakassati](vavakassati.md)* (vi \+ ava \+ kassati), supplementing the ordinary *[apakassati](apakassati.md)*. See meaning & further discussion under apakāsati\- Vin.ii.204 (apakāsati \+ ; variant reading avapakassati Bdhgh. in expln. on p. 325 has apapakāsati which seems to imply (a)vavakassati); AN.iii.145 sq. (avapakāsituṃ).

ava \+ pa \+ kāsati = kassati, fr. *kṛṣ*
