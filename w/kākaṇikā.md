= prec. Ja.i.120, Ja.i.419; Ja.vi.346; DN\-a.i.212; Dhp\-a.i.391; Vv\-a.77 = Dhp\-a.iii.108. From the latter passages its monetary value in the opinion of the Commentator may be guessed at as being 1/8 of a kahāpaṇa it occurs here in a descending line where each succeeding coin marks half the value of the preceding one, viz. kahāpaṇa, aḍḍha, pāda, māsaka, kākaṇikā, upon which follows mudhā “for nothing.”

* *\-[agghanaka](agghanaka.md)* “not even a farthing’s worth,” worth next to nothing Ja.vi.346.
