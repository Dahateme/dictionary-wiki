\*Phāṭeti

is conjectured reading for *[pāteti](pāteti.md)* in phrase *kaṭṭhaṃ pāteti* MN.i.21, and in *[adhipāteti](adhipāteti.md)* to split (see *[adhipāta](adhipāta.md)* & vipāta). The derivation of these expressions from; *pat* is out of place, where close relation to *[phāleti](phāleti.md)* (phalati) is evident, and a derivation from *phaṭ = sphat*, as in Sk. sphāṭayati to split, is the only right expln of meaning. In that case we should put *phal = sphaṭ*; where l = ṭ, as in many Pali words, cp phalika«spha geiger P.Gr. § 386). The Prk correspondent is phāḍei (Pischel, *Gr.* § 208).
