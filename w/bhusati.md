Bhusati, Bhussati

to bark DN\-a.i.317 (bhusati vv.ll. bhussati & bhūsati); Dhp\-a.i.171, Dhp\-a.i.172  
■ See also *bhasati & bhukka;*  
pp *[bhusita](bhusita.md)*.

perhaps a legitimate form for Sk. bhaṣate (see P. bhasati), with u for a, so that the suggested correction of bhusati to bhasati (see under *[bhasati](bhasati.md)*) is unfounded
