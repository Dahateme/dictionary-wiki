adjective that which is not being broken up or divided. In the stock descrīption of the varieties of the lower Iddhi the phrase *udake pi abhijjamāne gacchati* is doubtful. The principal passages are DN.i.78, DN.i.212; DN.iii.112, DN.iii.281; MN.i.34 MN.i.494; MN.ii.18; AN.i.170, AN.i.255; AN.iii.17; AN.v.199; SN.ii.121; SN.v.264 In about half of these passages the reading is abhijjamāno The various rcadings show that the MSS also are equally divided on this point. Bdgh. (Vism.396) reads ˚māne, and explains it, relying on Pts.ii.208, as that sort of water in which a man does not sink. Pv.iii.1#1 has the same idiom. Dhammapāla’s note on that (Pv\-a.169) is corrupt. At DN.i.78 the Colombo ed. 1904, reads *abhejjamāne* and tr. ʻnot dividing (the water)’; at DN.i.212 it reads *abhijjamāno* and tr. ʻnot sinking (in the water)’.
