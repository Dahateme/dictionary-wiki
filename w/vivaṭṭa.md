1. “rolling back,” with ref. to the development of the world (or the aeons kappa) used to denote a *devolving* cycle (“devolution”) whereas *[vaṭṭa](vaṭṭa.md)* alone or *[saṃvaṭṭa](saṃvaṭṭa.md)* denote the *involving* cycle (both either with or without kappa). Thus as “periods” of the world they practically mean the same thing & may both be interpreted in the sense of a; *new* beginning. As redupl  
   ■ inter. compounds they express only the idea of constant change. We sometimes find vivaṭṭa in the sense of “renewal” & saṃvaṭṭa in the sense of “destruction,” where we should expect the opposite meaning for each. See also *vaṭṭa & saṃvaṭta;* Dogmatically *[vivaṭṭa](vivaṭṭa.md)* is used as “absence of vaṭṭa, i.e. *[nibbāna](nibbāna.md)* or salvation from saṃsāra (see *[vaṭṭa](vaṭṭa.md)* cp. citta\-vivaṭṭa, ceto˚, ñāṇa˚, vimokkha˚ at Ps; i.108 & ii.70)  
   ■ Fig. in *kamma˚*; “the rolling back of k., i.e. devolution or course of kamma at SN.i.85  
   ■ Abs & combd with *[saṃvaṭṭa](saṃvaṭṭa.md)* (i.e. devolution combined with evolution) e.g. at DN.i.14, DN.i.16 sq.; DN.iii.109; AN.ii.142 (where read vivaṭṭe for vivaṭṭo); Pp.60; Vism.419 (here as m. *vivaṭṭo*, compared with saṃvaṭṭo), Vism.420 (˚ṭṭhāyin) In cpd. *\-kappa* (i.e. descending aeon) at DN.iii.51; Pp.60; Iti.15.
