Kilesa & klesa

stain, soil, impurity, fig. affliction; in a moral sense, depravity, lust. Its occurrence in the Piṭakas is rare; in later works, very frequent, where it is approx. tantamount to our terms lower, or unregenerate nature, sinful desires, vices passions.

1. Kilesa as obstacle (see ˚*[āvaraṇa](āvaraṇa.md)*, ˚\-sampayutta ˚\-vippayutta, ˚pahāna) Pts.i.33; Sdhp.455; bhikkhu bhinnakileso “one whose passions are broken up Vb.246, Pv\-a.51; upasanta kileso “one whose passions are calmed” Pv\-a.230; no ce pi jātu puriso kilese vāto yathā abbhaghanaṃ vihāne Snp.348; pariyodapeyya attānaṃ cittaklesehi paṇḍito SN.v.24 = AN.v.232, AN.v.253 = Dhp.88.
2. Occurs in such combinations as kilesā ca khandhā ca abhisankhārā ca Cnd.487; kilesa \+ khandha: Pts.i.69 Pts.i.72; Pts.ii.36, Pts.ii.140; cp. Vb.44, Vb.68; kilesa \+ saṃsāra Pv\-a.7 kammaṃ kilesā hetu saṃsārassa Ne.113, cp. Ne.191
3. kilesa also occurs in a series explanatory of taṇhā, in the stereotype combination of t., diṭṭhi, kilesa “clinging to existence, false ideas and lust” (see Cnd. s.v. taṇhā v.).
4. In the same function it stands with rāga, viz rāga dosa moha kilesa, i.e. sensuality, bewilderment and lust (see Cnd. s.v. rāga ii.), cp. Dhs.982, Dhs.1006. The grouping as *[dasa](dasa.md)* kilesa\-vatthūni is: lobha dosa moha māna diṭṭhi vicikicchā thīnaṃ uddhaccaṃ ahirikaṃ anottappaṃ Dhs.1548 = Vb.341; Vism.683; mentioned at Pts.i.130  
   ■ These with the exception of the last two, are also grouped as *[aṭṭha](aṭṭha.md)* k˚\-vatthūni at Vb.385  
   ■ As three kilesas (past, present and future at Pts.ii.217.
5. The giving up of kilesa is one of the four essentials of perfection: the recognition of evil the removal of its source (which is kilesa), the meditation on the Path, and the realization of the extinction of evil ‣See Cnd s.v. dukkha ii. Kilesa in this connection interchanges with samudaya, as denoting the *origin* of evil; cp. samudayo kilesā Netti.191.
