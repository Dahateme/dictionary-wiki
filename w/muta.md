thought, supposed, imagined (i.e. received by other vaguer sense impressions than by sight & hearing) MN.i.3; Snp.714 (= phusan’ arahaṃ Snp\-a.498), Snp.812; Ja.v.398 (= anumata C.) Vb.14, Vb.429 sq  
■ Often in set *diṭṭha suta muta* what is seen, heard & thought (? more likely “felt,” cp Cnd.298: diṭṭha = cakkhunā d., sutaṃ = sotena s. mutaṃ = ghānena ghāyitaṃ, jivhāya sāyitaṃ, kāyena phuṭṭaṃ, *and* viññātaṃ = manasā v.; so that from the interpretation it follows that d. s. m. v. refer to the action (perception) of the 6 senses, where muta covers the 3 of taste, smell & touch, and viññāta the function of the manas) SN.i.186 (*K.S.* i.237 note); SN.iv.73; Thag.1216. Similarly the psychol. analysis of the senses at Dhs.961: rūp’ āyatanaṃ diṭṭhaṃ; sadd\-āyat. sutaṃ gandh˚, ras˚, phoṭṭhabb˚ mutaṃ; sabbaṃ rūpaṃ manasā viññātaṃ. See on this passage *Dhs trsl.* § 961 note. In the same sense Dhs\-a.388 (see *Expositor*, ii.439)  
■ DN.iii.232; Snp.790 (cp. Mnd.87 sq. *in extenso* Snp.793, Snp.798, Snp.812, Snp.887, Snp.901, Snp.914, Snp.1086, Snp.1122. Thus quite a main tenet of the old (popular) psychology.

* *\-[maṅgalika](maṅgalika.md)* one who prophesies from, or derives lucky auspices from impressions (of sense; as compd with diṭṭha\-mangalika visible\-omen\-hunter, and suta\-m sound\-augur) Ja.iv.73 (where C. clearly explains by “touch”); Kp\-a.119 (the same expln more in detail)
* *\-visuddhika* of great purity, i.e. orthodox, successful, in matters of touch Mnd.89, Mnd.90.
* *\-[suddhi](suddhi.md)* purity in matter of touch Mnd.104, Mnd.105.
