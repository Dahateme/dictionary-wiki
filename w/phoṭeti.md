to shake, toss (or thunder?) only at two places in similar formula, viz. devatā sādhukāraṃ adaṃsu, brahmāno apphoṭesuṃ (variant reading appoṭh˚) Mil.13 Mil.18; Sakko devarājā appoṭhesi (variant reading appoṭesi), Mahābrahmā sādhukāraṃ adāsi Ja.vi.486. Perhaps we should read *[poṭheti](poṭheti.md)* (q.v.), to snap one’s fingers (clap hands) as sign of applause. At Dhp\-a.iii.210 we read fut. *apphoṭessāmi* (i.e. ā \+ phoṭ).

Caus. of *sphuṭ*; if correct. Maybe mixed with *sphūrj*. The form apphoṭesi seems to be ā \+ phoṭeti Sk. āsphoṭayati
