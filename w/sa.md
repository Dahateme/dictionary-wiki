Sa1

the letter *s* (sa\-kāra) Snp\-a.23; or the syllable *[sa](sa.md)* Dhp\-a.ii.6; Pv\-a.280.

Sa2

base of the nom. of the demonstr. pron. that, he she. The form sg. m. *[sa](sa.md)* is rare (e.g. Dhp.142; Snp.89) According to Geiger (*P.Gr.* § 105) *[sa](sa.md)* occurs in Snp.40 times but *[so](so.md)* 124 times. In later Pāli *[sa](sa.md)* is almost extinct The final *[o](o.md)* of *[so](so.md)* is often changed into *v* before vowels and a short vowel is lengthened after this *v: svājja* Snp.998 = so ajja; svāhaṃ Ja.i.167 = so ahaṃ; svāyaṃ Vin.i.2 = so ayaṃ. The foll. vowel is dropped in *so maṃ* Iti.57 = so imaṃ  
■ A form *[se](se.md)* is Māgadhism for nt. acc sg. *taṃ*, found e.g. at DN.ii.278, DN.ii.279; MN.ii.254, MN.ii.255, and in combination *seyyathā, seyyathīdaṃ* (for which taṃyathā Mil.1). An idiomatic use is that of *[so](so.md)* in meaning of “that (he or somebody),” e.g. “so vata… palipanno paraṃ palipannaṃ uddharissatī ti: n’ etaṃ ṭhānaṃ vijjati” MN.i.45; cp. “sā ‘haṃ dhammaṃ nâssosiṃ” that I did not hear the Dh. Vv.40#5. Or in the sense of a cond. (or causal) part. “if,” or “once,” e.g. sa kho so bhikkhu… upakkileso ti iti viditvā… upakkilesaṃ pajahati “once he has recognised…” MN.i.37 Cp. *[ya˚](ya˚.md)*; ii.2 b. On correl. use with *[ya˚](ya˚.md)*; (yo so etc.) see *[ya](ya.md)*˚; ii.1.

Idg. *\*so\-* (m.), *\*sā\-* (f.); nom. sg. to base *\*to\-* of the oblique cases; cp. Sk. sa (saḥ), sā; Av. hō, hā; Gr. ὁ, ἡ; Goth. sa, sō; Ags. sē “the” (= that one); pe\-s = E thi\-s

Sa3

prefix, used as first pt. of compounds, is the sense of “with,” possessed of, having same as; e.g. *[sadevaka](sadevaka.md)* with the devas Vin.i.8; *[sadhammika](sadhammika.md)* having common faith DN.ii.273; *[sajāti](sajāti.md)* having the same origin Ja.ii.108. Often opposed to *a\-* and other neg. prefixes (like *nir˚*;). Sometimes almost pleonastical (like sa\-antara)  
■ Of combinations we only mention a few of those in which a vocalic initial of the 2nd pt remains uncontracted. Other examples see under their heading in alph. order. E.g. sa *\-[antara](antara.md)* inside Dhp\-a.iii.788 (for santara Dhp.315); sa *\-Inda* together with Indra DN.ii.261, DN.ii.274; AN.v.325 sq.; *\-\-uttara* having something beyond, inferior (opp. an˚) DN.i.80; DN.ii.299 = MN.i.59; Dhs.1292, Dhs.1596; Dhs\-a.50; *\-\-uttaracchada (& ˚chadana);* a carpet with awnings above it DN.i.7≈; DN.ii.187 (˚ava) AN.i.181; Vin.i.192; DN\-a.i.87; *\-udaka* with water, wet Vin.i.46; *\-udariya* born from the same womb, a brother Ja.iv.417, cp. sodariya; *\-uddesa* with explanation Iti.99 Vism.423 (nāma\-gotta\-vasena sa\-udd.; vaṇṇ’ādi\-vasena sākāra); *\-upanisa* together with its cause, causally associated SN.ii.30; *\-upavajja* having a helper MN.iii.266 *\-upādāna* showing attachment MN.ii.265; *\-upādisesa* having the substratum of life remaining Snp.354; Iti.38 Ne.92. Opp. anupādisesa; *\-ummi* roaring of the billows Iti.57, Iti.114
