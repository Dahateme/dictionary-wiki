Phala1

neuter to burst, thus lit. “bursting,” i.e. ripe fruit; see *[phalati](phalati.md)*]

1. (lit. fruit (of trees etc.) Vv.84#14 (dumā nicca\-phal’ ûpapannā not to phalu, as Kern,

    s. v. phalu); Vism.120\- *amba˚*; mango\-fruit Pv\-a.273 sq.; *dussa˚*; (adj.) having clothes as their fruit (of magic trees) Vv.46#2 (cp. Vv\-a.199); *patta˚*; leaves & fruits, vegetables Snp.239; Pv\-a.86 *pavatta˚*; wild fruit DN.i.101; *puppha˚*; flower & fruit Ja.iii.40. *rukkha˚\-ūpama* Thag.490 (in simile of kāmā taken fr. MN.i.130) lit. “like the fruit of trees is explained by Thag\-a.288 as “anga\-paccangānaṃ p(h)alibhañjan’ aṭṭhena, and trsld according to this interpretation by Mrs. Rh. D. as “fruit that brings the climber to a fall.”\-Seven kinds of medicinal fruits are given at Vin.i.201 scil. vilanga, pippala, marica, harītaka vibhītaka, āmalaka, goṭhaphala. At Mil.333 a set of 7 fruits is used metaphorically in simile of the Buddha’s fruit\-shop, viz. sotāpatti˚, sakadāgāmi˚, anāgāmi˚ arahatta˚, suññata˚ samāpatti (cp. *Cpd.* 70), animitta˚ samāpatti, appaṇihita˚ samāpatti.
2. a testicle Ja.iii.124 (dantehi ˚ṃ chindati = purisabhāvaṃ nāseti to castrate); Ja.vi.237 (uddhita\-pphalo, adj., = uddhaṭa\-bījo C.), Ja.vi.238 (dantehi phalāni uppāṭeti, like above).
3. (fig.) fruit, result, consequence, fruition, blessing As t.t. with ref. to the Path and the progressive attainment (enjoyment, fruition) of Arahantship it is used to denote the realization of having attained each stage of the sotāpatti, sakadāgāmi etc. (see the Mil quot under 1 and cp. *Cpd.* 45, 116). So freq. in exegetical literature *magga, phala, nibbāna*, e.g. Tikp.155, Kp.158 Vb\-a.43 & passim  
   ■ In general it immediately precedes Nibbāna (see Cnd no 645b and under satipaṭṭhāna) and as *agga\-phala* it is almost identical with Arahantship Frequently it is combined with *[vipāka](vipāka.md)* to denote the stringent conception of “consequence,” e.g. at DN.i.27, DN.i.58; DN.iii.160. Almost synonymous in the sense of “fruition, benefit, profit” is ānisaṃsā DN.iii.132 phala at Pv.i.12#5 = ānisaṃsa Pv\-a.64\- Vin.i.293 (anāgāmi˚); Vin.ii.240 (id.); Vin.iii.73 (arahatta˚); DN.i.51 DN.i.57 sq. (sāmañña˚); DN.iii.147, DN.iii.170 (sucaritassa); MN.i.477 (appamāda˚); SN.i.173 (Amata˚); Pv.i.11#10 (kaṭuka˚), Pv.ii.8#3 (dāna˚); Pv.iv.1#88 (mahap˚ & agga˚); Vism.345 (of food, being digested); Pv\-a.8 (puñña˚ & dāna˚), Pv\-a.22 (sotāpatti˚), Pv\-a.24 (issā\-macchariya˚).
