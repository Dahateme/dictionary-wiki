only at DN.iii.43 in phrase ˚ṃ āpajjati in meaning of “making a distinction,” being particular (about food: bhojanesu), having a dainty appetite; explained by “dve bhāge karoti” Bdhgh. It seems to stand for *[vokāra](vokāra.md)*, unless we take it to be a misspelling for *[vodāya](vodāya.md)* “cutting off,” fr. vi \+ ava \+ *dā*, thus “separating the food” (?): Suggestive also is the likeness with *vosānaṃ* āpajjati.
