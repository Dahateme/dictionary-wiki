adjective that which is prone, going prone; DN\-a.i.23 where the passage is “tiracchāna\-gata\-pāṇāpoṇika\-nikāyo cikkhallika\-nikāyo ti,” quoted from SN.iii.152, where it runs thus: “tiracchāna\-gata pāṇā te pi bhikkhave tiracchānagatā pāṇā citten’ eva cittatā. The passage is referred to *with* poṇika at Kp\-a.12 where we read “tiracchāna\-gatā pāṇā poṇika\-nikāyo cikkhallika\-nikāyo ti.” Thus we may take *poṇikanikāya* as “the kingdom of those which go prone (i.e. the animals).
