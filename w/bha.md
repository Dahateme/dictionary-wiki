indeclinable the letter or sound (syllable) bh; figuring in Bdhgh’s exegesis of the N. *Bhagavā* as representing *bhava*, whereas *ga* stands for *gamana*, *[va](va.md)* for *vanta* Kp\-a.109  
■ Like *ba˚*; we often find *bha˚*; mixed up with *[pa˚](pa˚.md)*  
■ see e.g. bhaṇḍa bhaṇḍati; bh represents b. in bhasta = Sk. basta, bhisa = Sk. bisa, bhusa = Sk buśa  
■ *bha\-kāra* the sound (or ending) *\-bha*, which at Vin.iv.7 is given as implying contempt or abuse among other low terms (hīnā akkosā). This refers also to the sound (ending) *\-ya* (see *[ya](ya.md)*\-kāra). The expln for this probably is that *\-bha* is abstracted from words ending thus, where the word itself meant something inferior or contemptible, and this shade of meaning was regarded as inhering in the ending, not in the root of the word, as e.g. in *[ibbha](ibbha.md)* (menial).
