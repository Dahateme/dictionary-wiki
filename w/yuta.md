fastened to (loc.), attracted by, bent on, engaged in DN.i.57 (sabba\-vārī˚); Snp.842 (pesuṇeyye; Mnd.233 reads yutta in exegesis, do. at Mnd.p.234, with further expln āyutta, payutta etc.), Snp.853 (atimāne); Dāvs v.18 (dhiti˚)  
■ *Note.* *[yuta](yuta.md)* is doubtful in phrase *tejasā\-yuta* in Niraya passage at AN.i.142 = MN.iii.183 = Mnd.405 = Cnd.304#iii = Ja.v.266. The more likely reading is either *tejas’ āyuta* (so BSk. Mhvs.9), or *tejasā yutta* (so Nd ii.& Pv\-a.52), i.e. endowed with, furnished with full of heat  
■ We find a similar confusion between; *uyyuta & uyyutta*.

pp. of *yu*, yauti to fasten but Dhtp.338: “missane”
